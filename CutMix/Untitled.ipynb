    "### Abstract\n",
    "Regional dropout strategies have been proposed to enhance the performance of convolutional neural network classifiers. \n",
    "They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects \n",
    "(e.g. leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities.\n",
    "On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout removes informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. \n",
    "Such removal is not desirable because it leads to information loss and inefficiency during training.\n",
    "We therefore propose the **CutMix** augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches.\n",
    "By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on the ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task.\n",
    "Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gains in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks.\n",
    "We also show that CutMix improves the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of-distribution detection performances.\n",

      "An auditory electrophysiological study was conducted to explore the influence of language experience on the saliency of dimensions underlying cortical pitch processing. Mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to Mandarin tones were recorded in Chinese and English participants (n=10 per group) using a passive oddball paradigm. Stimuli consisted of three tones (T1: high level; T2: high rising; T3: low falling-rising). There were three oddball conditions (standard/deviant): T1/T2, T1/T3, T2/T3. In the T1/T2 and T1/T3 conditions, each tonal pair represented a contrast between a level and a contour tone; the T2/T3 condition, a contrast between two contour tones. Twenty dissimilarity matrices were created using the MMN mean amplitude measured from the Fz location for each condition per participant, and analyzed by an individual differences multidimensional scaling model. Two pitch dimensions were revealed, interpretively labeled as 'height' and 'contour'. The latter was found to be more important for Chinese than English subjects. Using individual weights on the contour dimension, a discriminant function showed that 17 out of 20 participants were correctly classified into their respective language groups. The MMN can serve as an index of pitch features that are differentially weighted depending on a listener's experience with lexical tones and their acoustic correlates within a particular tone space.

      "Establishing the correct alcohol use disorder diagnosis is clinically relevant because several reports of post-transplant alcohol use suggest that a pre-transplant diagnosis of alcohol dependence (rather than abuse) predicts relapse to alcohol use. Numerous combinations of specific symptoms are possible to achieve diagnostic significance. The authors hypothesized that there would be distinct clusters of liver transplant recipients who showed specific combinations of alcohol-related symptoms and that these clusters would be predictive of alcohol-abuse outcome after transplant. A group of 120 ALD liver transplant recipients received the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) module for alcohol abuse/dependence, and a cluster analysis was performed. Within the clusters of those with alcohol dependence, cluster assignment did not predict those more likely to drink. However, those assigned to the alcohol abuse cluster were significantly less likely to drink than those with alcohol dependence. Results therefore suggest that the prognosis regarding continued abstinence posttransplant is much more positive for individuals with a diagnosis of abuse than for those who meet criteria for alcohol dependence. 8JWvd@126.com\n",

      "Minimally invasive methods of predicting the risk of muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma may expedite appropriate therapy and reduce morbidity and cost. Here, capillary electrophoresis coupled mass spectrometry was used to identify urinary polypeptide bladder cancer biomarkers in 127 patients. These markers were used to construct a panel discriminating muscle-invasive from noninvasive disease, which was refined in 297 additional samples from healthy volunteers, patients with malignant and nonmalignant genitourinary conditions. Sequencing of panel polypeptides was then done. Finally, the ability of the panel to predict muscle-invasive disease was evaluated prospectively in 130 bladder carcinoma patients. Four sequenced polypeptides formed a panel predictive of muscle-invasive disease. Prospective evaluation of this panel revealed a sensitivity of 81% [95% confidence interval (CI), 69-90] and specificity of 57% (95% CI, 45-69) for muscle-invasive disease. Multivariate analysis revealed the panel (P < 0.0001) and tumor grade (P = 0.0001), but not urine cytology, predict muscle invasion. A model including grade and panel polypeptide levels improved sensitivity [92% (95% CI, 82-97)] and specificity [68% (95% CI, 55-79)] for muscle-invasive disease. A model score of >0.88 provided a negative predictive value of 77% and positive predictive value of 90% for muscle invasion. Use of urinary peptides seems promising in estimating the probability a patient harbors muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer. These peptides may also shed novel insights into the biology of bladder tumor progression not obtainable by other methods. Clinical trials seem warranted to evaluate the effect of this approach on practice. i8OkdG@fudan.edu.cn\n",

      "The aims of this study were to: (i) assess gender differences of objective sleep patterns in a general population sample; (ii) evaluate the effects of menopause and hormone treatment (HT) on the sleep of the same cohort; and (iii) examine gender differences in sleep resilience towards external stressors. The participants were (i) 1324 subjects without sleep complaints, recruited from the general population of Central Pennsylvania that spent one night in the sleep laboratory and (ii) 66 young, healthy volunteers whose sleep was disturbed during night four by an external stressor, i.e. 24-h blood drawing (average of nights 2 and 3 versus night 4). Women compared with men in the general population sample had significantly higher percentage of sleep time, lower percentage of stage 1, and higher percentage of slow wave sleep. Also, menopause, in the absence of HT, was associated with prolonged sleep latency and decreased deep sleep. Finally, young, healthy women compared with men experienced less sleep disturbance because of blood draws as indicated by a significantly smaller change in per cent sleep time, and percentage of stage 1 sleep. These findings suggest that women without sleep complaints sleep objectively better across age than men and the sleep of young women is more resistant to external stressors. Also, gonadal hormones exert a beneficial effect on women's sleep. This gender dimorphism in sleep regulation may have been to protect women from the demands of infant and child care, and in part, might contribute to women's lower cardiovascular risks and greater longevity.

      "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in neurodevelopment and plasticity; decreased BDNF functioning may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, BDNF levels are not static; in animal experiments, brain BDNF increases during spatial learning, and in clinical depression, successful antidepressant treatment raises serum BDNF. We asked: would neuroplasticity-based cognitive training in schizophrenia result in increased serum BDNF? Fifty-six schizophrenia outpatients and 16 matched healthy comparison subjects were assessed on baseline cognitive performance and serum BDNF. Schizophrenia subjects were randomly assigned to either 50 hours (10 weeks) of computerized auditory training or a computer game control condition, followed by reassessment of cognition and serum BDNF. At baseline, schizophrenia participants had significantly lower-than-normal serum BDNF. Schizophrenia subjects who engaged in computerized cognitive training designed to improve auditory processing showed significant cognitive gains and a significant increase in serum BDNF compared with subjects who played computer games. This increase was evident after 2 weeks of training, and after 10 weeks in the active condition, subjects \"\"normalized\"\" their mean serum BDNF levels, whereas the control group showed no change. In the active condition, change in BDNF was significantly associated with improved quality of life. Serum BDNF levels are significantly increased in clinically stable, chronically ill schizophrenia subjects after neuroplasticity-based cognitive training, but not after computer games. Serum BDNF levels may serve as a peripheral biomarker for the effects of intensive cognitive training and may provide a useful tool for the evaluation of cognitive enhancement methods in schizophrenia. 1087576020\n",

      "Most cancer deaths are a result of metastasis. To extend our understanding of the factors that influence the process, we aimed to develop a mouse model of pulmonary metastasis that can be assayed in multiple inbred mouse strains for further use in identification of host genetic variants that influence metastasis. We used i.v. injection of Sarcoma 180 (S180) cells, which can be tracked and quantified by bioluminescence imaging. We observed growth of S180 cells solely in the lung and observed a wide range of pulmonary metastasis among inbred mouse strains. Interestingly, we noted that the BTBRT+tf/J strain exhibited complete clearance and provide evidence that the mechanism of resistance may involve immune factors, as strains subjected to whole-body irradiation are significantly more susceptible to tumor growth. One possible mechanism of resistance to pulmonary metastasis in BTBRT+tf/J mice may require T-cell function. Our experiments present a new mouse model for further characterization of the genetics and mechanisms of pulmonary metastasis. 12259181463\n",

      "Abstract Here we review a novel class of delivery vehicles based on pH-sensitive, moderately polar membrane peptides, which we call pH (Low) Insertion Peptides (pHLIPs), that target cells located in the acidic environment found in many diseased tissues, including tumours. Acidity targeting by pHLIPs is achieved as a result of helix formation and transmembrane insertion. In contrast to the earlier technologies based on cell-penetrating peptides, pHLIPs act as monomeric membrane-inserting peptides that translocate one terminus across a membrane into the cytoplasm, while the other terminus remains in the extracellular space, locating the peptide in the membrane lipid bilayer. Therefore pHLIP has a dual delivery capability: it can tether cargo molecules or nanoparticles to the surfaces of cells in diseased tissues and/or it can move a cell-impermeable cargo molecule across the membrane into the cytoplasm. The source of energy for moving polar molecules attached to pHLIP through the hydrophobic layer of a membrane bilayer is the membrane-associated folding of the polypeptide. A drop in pH leads to the protonation of negatively charged residues (Asp or Glu), which enhances peptide hydrophobicity, increasing the affinity of the peptide for the lipid bilayer and triggering peptide folding and subsequent membrane insertion. The process is accompanied by the release of energy that can be utilized to move cell-impermeable cargo across a membrane. That the mechanism is now understood, and that targeting of tumours in mice has been shown, suggest a number of future applications of the pHLIP technology in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

      "Zebrafish can provide a valuable animal model to screen potential cognitive enhancing and anxiolytic drugs. They are economical and can provide a relatively quick indication of possible functional efficacy. In as much as they have a complex nervous system and elaborate behavioral repertoire, zebrafish can provide a good intermediate model between in vitro receptor and cell-based assays and classic mammalian models for drug screening. In addition, the variety of molecular tools available in zebrafish makes them outstanding models for helping to determine the neuromolecular mechanisms for psychoactive drugs. However, to use zebrafish as a translational model we must have validated, sensitive and efficient behavioral tests. In a series of studies, our lab has developed tests of cognitive function and stress response, which are sensitive to drug effects in a similar manner as rodent models and humans for cognitive enhancement and alleviating stress response. In particular, the three-chamber task for learning and memory was shown to be sensitive to the cognitive enhancing effects of nicotine and has been useful in helping to determine neural mechanisms crucial for nicotinic-induced cognitive enhancement. The novel tank diving test was shown to be a valid and efficient test of stress response. It is sensitive to the reduction in stress-related behaviors due to the amxiolytic drugs diazepam and buspirone but not chlordiazepoxide. Nicotine also causes stress alleviating effects which can be interpreted as anxiolytic effects. Zebrafish models of behavioral pharmacology can be useful to efficiently screen test compounds for drug development and can be useful in helping to determine the mechanisms crucial for new therapeutic treatments of neurobehavioral impairments. 1226605996\n",

      "Cetuximab, an antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, is an effective clinical therapy for patients with colorectal, head and neck, and non-small cell lung cancer, particularly for those with KRAS and BRAF wild-type cancers. Treatment in all patients is limited eventually by the development of acquired resistance, but little is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we show that activation of ERBB2 signaling in cell lines, either through ERBB2 amplification or through heregulin up-regulation, leads to persistent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling and consequently to cetuximab resistance. Inhibition of ERBB2 or disruption of ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimerization restores cetuximab sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. A subset of colorectal cancer patients who exhibit either de novo or acquired resistance to cetuximab-based therapy has ERBB2 amplification or high levels of circulating heregulin. Collectively, these findings identify two distinct resistance mechanisms, both of which promote aberrant ERBB2 signaling, that mediate cetuximab resistance. Moreover, these results suggest that ERBB2 inhibitors, in combination with cetuximab, represent a rational therapeutic strategy that should be assessed in patients with cetuximab-resistant cancers. +86-7708158485\n",

      "ALK gene rearrangement defines a new molecular subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In a recent phase 1 clinical trial, the ALK tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib showed marked antitumour activity in patients with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC. To assess whether crizotinib affects overall survival in these patients, we did a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in crizotinib-treated patients in the trial and crizotinib-naive controls screened during the same time period. We examined overall survival in patients with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC who enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial of crizotinib, focusing on the cohort of 82 patients who had enrolled through Feb 10, 2010. For comparators, we identified 36 ALK-positive patients from trial sites who were not given crizotinib (ALK-positive controls), 67 patients without ALK rearrangement but positive for EGFR mutation, and 253 wild-type patients lacking either ALK rearrangement or EGFR mutation. To assess differences in overall survival, we assessed subsets of clinically comparable ALK-positive and ALK-negative patients. Among 82 ALK-positive patients who were given crizotinib, median overall survival from initiation of crizotinib has not been reached (95% CI 17 months to not reached); 1-year overall survival was 74% (95% CI 63-82), and 2-year overall survival was 54% (40-66). Overall survival did not differ based on age, sex, smoking history, or ethnic origin. Survival in 30 ALK-positive patients who were given crizotinib in the second-line or third-line setting was significantly longer than in 23 ALK-positive controls given any second-line therapy (median overall survival not reached [95% CI 14 months to not reached] vs 6 months [4-17], 1-year overall survival 70% [95% CI 50-83] vs 44% [23-64], and 2-year overall survival 55% [33-72] vs 12% [2-30]; hazard ratio 0*36, 95% CI 0*17-0*75; p=0*004). Survival in 56 crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patients was similar to that in 63 ALK-negative, EGFR-positive patients given EGFR TKI therapy (median overall survival not reached [95% CI 17 months to not reached] vs 24 months [15-34], 1-year overall survival 71% [95% CI 58-81] vs 74% [61-83], and 2-year overall survival 57% [40-71] vs 52% [38-65]; p=0*786), whereas survival in 36 crizotinib-naive, ALK-positive controls was similar to that in 253 wild-type controls (median overall survival 20 months [95% CI 13-26] vs 15 months [13-17]; p=0*244). In patients with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC, crizotinib therapy is associated with improved survival compared with that of crizotinib-naive controls.

      "We examined sexual risk behaviors and unrecognized HIV infection among heterosexually active African-American and Hispanic women. Women not previously diagnosed with HIV infection were recruited in rural counties in North Carolina (African American) and Alabama (African American), and an urban county in southern Florida (Hispanic) using multiple methods. They completed a computer-administered questionnaire and were tested for HIV infection. Between October 2008 and September 2009, 1,527 women (1,013 African American and 514 Hispanic) enrolled in the study. Median age was 35 years (range, 18-59), 33% were married or living as married, 50% had an annual household income of $12,000 or less, and 56% were employed full or part time. Two women (0.13%) tested positive for HIV. In the past 12 months, 19% had been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (other than HIV), 87% engaged in unprotected vaginal intercourse (UVI), and 26% engaged in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). In multivariate analysis, UAI was significantly (p < .05) more likely among those who reported ever being pregnant, binge drinking in the past 30 days, ever exchanging sex for things needed or wanted, engaging in UVI, or being of Hispanic ethnicity. UAI was also more likely to occur with partners with whom women had a current or past relationship as opposed to casual partners. A high percentage of our sample of heterosexually active women of color had recently engaged in sexual risk behaviors, particularly UAI. More research is needed to elucidate the interpersonal dynamics that may promote this high-risk behavior. Educational messages that explicitly address the risks of heterosexual anal intercourse need to be developed for heterosexually active women and their male partners.

This randomized phase II study evaluated the outcome of erlotinib with and without the isoform selective HDACi, entinostat. Previously treated patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer, no prior EGFR-TKIs, and performance status <= 2 were randomly administered erlotinib 150 mg on days 1 through 28 plus entinostat 10 mg orally on days 1 and 15 every 28 days (EE) or erlotinib plus placebo (EP). The primary end point was 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate with additional end points including 6-month PFS rate, PFS, and overall survival (OS). Exploratory analyses included EMT- and EGFR-related biomarker analysis on archival tissue. One hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled (EE, 67; EP, 65). The 4-month PFS rate was comparable for both groups (EE, 18% v EP, 20%; P = .7). In the subset of patients with high E-cadherin levels, OS was longer in the EE group compared with the EP group (9.4 v 5.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.92; P = .03) with a corresponding trend toward increased PFS. The adverse event (AE) profile was acceptable, with rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea the most common AEs in both groups. Erlotinib combined with entinostat did not improve the outcomes of patients in the overall study population when compared with erlotinib monotherapy. High E-cadherin expression levels at time of diagnosis indicate an increased sensitivity to HDACi/EGFR-TKI inhibition providing the basis for a biomarker-driven validation study. B8WKw@163.com\n",

      "Insomnia with objective short sleep duration appears to be a biologically more severe phenotype of the disorder. No longitudinal study to date has examined the association of this type of insomnia with incident hypertension using polysomnography. From a random, general population sample of 1741 adults of the Penn State Cohort, 1395 were followed-up after 7.5 years, and 786 did not have hypertension at baseline. Hypertension was determined by a self-report of receiving treatment for high blood pressure. Chronic insomnia was defined as a complaint of insomnia lasting >=1 year, whereas poor sleep was defined as moderate-to-severe sleep difficulties. All of the subjects underwent 8-hour polysomnography. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) was defined as an obstructive apnea/hypopnea index>=5. We used the median polysomnographic percentage of sleep time to define short sleep duration (ie, <6 hours). We controlled for sex, race, age, caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol consumption, depression, sleep-disordered breathing, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and blood pressure in our analyses. Compared with normal sleepers who slept>=6 hours, the highest risk for incident hypertension was in chronic insomniacs with short sleep duration (odds ratio, 3.8 [95% CI, 1.6-9.0]). The risk for incident hypertension in poor sleepers with short sleep duration was significantly increased but became marginally significant after controlling for obesity (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 0.9-2.8]). Chronic insomnia with short sleep duration is associated with an increased risk for incident hypertension in a degree comparable to sleep-disordered breathing.

      "Until recently, the association of chronic insomnia with significant medical morbidity was not established and its diagnosis was based solely on subjective complaints. We present evidence that insomnia with objective short sleep duration is the most biologically severe phenotype of the disorder, as it is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal, activation of both limbs of the stress system, and a higher risk for hypertension, impaired heart rate variability, diabetes, neurocognitive impairment, and mortality. Also, it appears that objective short sleep duration is a biological marker of genetic predisposition to chronic insomnia. In contrast, insomnia with objective normal sleep duration is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal and sleep misperception but not with signs of activation of both limbs of the stress system or medical complications. Furthermore, the first phenotype is associated with unremitting course, whereas the latter is more likely to remit. We propose that short sleep duration in insomnia is a reliable marker of the biological severity and medical impact of the disorder. Objective measures of sleep obtained in the home environment of the patient would become part of the routine assessment of insomnia patients in a clinician's office setting. We speculate that insomnia with objective short sleep duration has primarily biological roots and may respond better to biological treatments, whereas insomnia with objective normal sleep duration has primarily psychological roots and may respond better to psychological interventions alone.

Based on preclinical data supporting the relevance of alpha-folate receptors in adenocarcinoma of the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) subtype, this trial was designed to assess pemetrexed in patients with this pathologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma. Patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion) or stage IV adenocarcinoma with BAC features or pure BAC were eligible. Treatment consisted of pemetrexed, 500 mg/m(2), administered intravenously every 21 days. Of 27 patients enrolled, 24 were eligible and assessable for adverse events: Toxicity was primarily hematologic, consisting of leukopenia/neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The median follow-up among patients still alive (n = 8) was 35 months (range, 26-47 months). Among 17 patients with measurable disease, the response rate was 23% (all partial responses; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-56%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 6 and 25 months, respectively. Pemetrexed is active and well tolerated and, in patients with adenocarcinoma BAC subtypes, likely related to its underlying mechanism of action as a multitargeted antifolate drug.

This study is designed to determine the feasibility of using multiparametric MRI endpoints to predict differences in seizure susceptibility after experimental TBI. MRI imaging and behavioral measurements were performed at multiple time points after lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) in rats. Seizure susceptibility was determined by video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and off-line signal analysis after chemoconvulsant challenge. Multiple MRI endpoints, including measures of injury-related brain swelling (normalized interhemispheric volume difference, NIVD) and T1-weighted signal change with contrast enhancement (a measure of blood-brain barrier disruption, BBBD), reliably distinguished between injured and sham-injured animals at 72 hours after injury. ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values (a measure of water diffusivity) in injured cortex at 72 hours and 1 week after injury, BBBD in injured cortex at 72 hours after injury and NIVD at 72 hours after injury were significantly correlated with EEG-based measures of seizure susceptibility to chemoconvulsant challenge at 3 months after injury. The correlations between our MRI quantitative endpoints and EEG-based measures of seizure susceptibility to chemoconvulsant challenge in injured animals versus sham-injured animals support the feasibility of these MRI endpoints as potential biomarkers for post-traumatic epileptogenesis. 1418934114\n",

We have characterized the sensory input to the cutaneous trunk muscle (CTM; also cutaneus trunci [rat] or cutaneus maximus [mouse]) reflex (CTMR), which manifests as a puckering of the dorsal thoracolumbar skin and is selectively driven by noxious stimuli. CTM electromyography and neurogram recordings in naive rats revealed that CTMR responses were elicited by natural stimuli and electrical stimulation of all segments from C4 to L6, a much greater extent of segmental drive to the CTMR than previously described. Stimulation of some subcutaneous paraspinal tissue can also elicit this reflex. Using a selective neurotoxin, we also demonstrate differential drive of the CTMR by trkA-expressing and nonexpressing small-diameter afferents. These observations highlight aspects of the organization of the CTMR system that make it attractive for studies of nociception and anesthesiology and plasticity of primary afferents, motoneurons, and the propriospinal system. We use the CTMR system to demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that experimental pharmacological treatments can be compared with controls applied either to the contralateral side or to another segment, with the remaining segments providing controls for systemic or other treatment effects. These data indicate the potential for using the CTMR system as both an invasive and a noninvasive quantitative assessment tool providing improved statistical power and reduced animal use.

      "The number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has increased rapidly in the past couple of years, resulting in the identification of genes associated with different diseases. The next step in translating these findings into biomedically useful information is to find out the mechanism of the action of these genes. However, GWAS studies often implicate genes whose functions are currently unknown; for example, MYEOV, ANKLE1, TMEM45B and ORAOV1 are found to be associated with breast cancer, but their molecular function is unknown. We carried out Bayesian inference of Gene Ontology (GO) term annotations of genes by employing the directed acyclic graph structure of GO and the network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The approach is designed based on the fact that two proteins that interact biophysically would be in physical proximity of each other, would possess complementary molecular function, and play role in related biological processes. Predicted GO terms were ranked according to their relative association scores and the approach was evaluated quantitatively by plotting the precision versus recall values and F-scores (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) versus varying thresholds. Precisions of ~58% and ~ 40% for localization and functions respectively of proteins were determined at a threshold of ~30 (top 30 GO terms in the ranked list). Comparison with function prediction based on semantic similarity among nodes in an ontology and incorporation of those similarities in a k-nearest neighbor classifier confirmed that our results compared favorably. This approach was applied to predict the cellular component and molecular function GO terms of all human proteins that have interacting partners possessing at least one known GO annotation. The list of predictions is available at http://severus.dbmi.pitt.edu/engo/GOPRED.html.

      "Lung adenocarcinoma (AdC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most common non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtypes, however, most genetic mouse models of lung cancer produce predominantly, if not exclusively, AdC. Whether this is secondary to targeting mutations to the distal airway cells or to the use of activating Kras mutations that drive AdC formation is unknown. We previously showed that targeting Kras(G12D) activation and transforming growth factor b receptor type II (TGFbRII) deletion to airway basal cells via a keratin promoter induced formation of both lung AdC and SCC. In this study we assessed if targeting phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) deletion to airway basal cells could initiate lung tumor formation or increase lung SCC formation. We found that PTEN deletion is capable of initiating both lung AdC and SCC formation when targeted to basal cells and although PTEN deletion is a weaker tumor initiator than Kras(G12D) with low tumor multiplicity and long latency, tumors initiated by PTEN deletion were larger and displayed more malignant conversion than Kras(G12D) initiated tumors. That PTEN deletion did not increase lung SCC formation compared to Kras(G12D) activation, suggests that the initiating genetic event does not dictate tumor histology when genetic alterations are targeted to a specific cell. These studies also confirm that basal cells of the conducting airway are capable of giving rise to multiple NSCLC tumor types. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. KKEu@126.com\n",

Application of cardiovascular risk prediction models holds great potential for primary prevention in this country. Using a unique set of cohort follow-up data from Moscow and Saint Petersburg, this study aims to test and recalibrate the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) methods for predicting CVD mortality risks in the general population. The study is based on pooled epidemiological cohort data covering the period 1975-2001. The algorithms from the SCORE project were used for the calibration of the SCORE equation for the Moscow and St. Petersburg populations (SCORE-MoSP). Age-specific 10-year cumulative cardiovascular mortality rates were estimated according to the original SCORE-High and SCORE-Low equations and compared to the estimates based on the recalibrated SCORE-MoSP model and observed CVD mortality rates. Ten-year risk prediction charts for CVD mortality were derived and compared using conventional SCORE-High and recalibrated SCORE-MoSP methods. The original SCORE-High model tends to substantially under-estimate 10-year cardiovascular mortality risk for females. The SCORE-MoSP model provided better results which were closer to the observed rates. For males, both the SCORE-High and SCORE-MoSP provided similar estimates which tend to under-estimate CVD mortality risk at younger ages. These differences are also reflected in the risk prediction charts. Using non-calibrated scoring models for Russia may lead to substantial under-estimation of cardiovascular mortality risk in some groups of individuals. Although the SCORE-MoSP provide better results for females, more complex scoring methods involving a wider range of risk factors are needed. +86-90960393373\n",

Composite persistence to all EBMs prescribed at discharge was low and not significantly different between academic and nonacademic hospitals at 90 days (46% vs 45%, adjusted incidence rate ratio = 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.04) and at 1 year (39% vs 39%, adjusted incidence rate ratio = 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.07). Rates of persistence to EBMs were similar between patients with MI >65 years old treated at academic versus nonacademic hospitals; however, persistence rates are low both early and late postdischarge, highlighting a continued need for quality improvement efforts to optimize post-MI management.

      "Schizophrenia patients exhibit impairments in auditory-based social cognition, indicated by deficits in detection of prosody, such as affective prosody and basic pitch perception. However, little is known about the psychometric properties of behavioral tests used to assess these functions. The goal of this paper is to characterize the properties of prosody and pitch perception tasks and to investigate whether they can be shortened. The pitch perception test evaluated is a tone-matching task developed by Javitt and colleagues (J-TMT). The prosody test evaluated is the auditory emotion recognition task developed by Juslin and Laukka (JL-AER). The sample includes 124 schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 131 healthy controls (HC). Properties, including facility and discrimination, of each item were assessed. Effects of item characteristics (e.g., emotion) were also evaluated. Shortened versions of the tests are proposed based on facility, discrimination, and/or ability of item characteristics to discriminate between patients and controls. Test-retest reliability is high for patients and controls for both the original and short forms of the J-TMT and JL-AER. Thus, the original as well as short forms of the J-TMT and JL-AER are suggested for inclusion in clinical trials of social cognitive and perceptual treatments. The development of short forms further increases the utility of these auditory tasks in clinical trials and clinical practice. The large SZ vs. HC differences reported here also highlight the profound nature of auditory deficits and a need for remediation. Copyright (c) 2014. Published by Elsevier Inc. +86-87628309761\n",

      "A primary goal of research on developmental critical periods (CPs) is the recapitulation of a juvenile-like state of malleability in the adult brain that might enable recovery from injury. These ambitions are often framed in terms of the simple reinstatement of enhanced plasticity in the growth-restricted milieu of an injured adult brain. Here, we provide an analysis of the similarities and differences between deprivation-induced and injury-induced cortical plasticity, to provide for a nuanced comparison of these remarkably similar processes. As a first step, we review the factors that drive ocular dominance plasticity in the primary visual cortex of the uninjured brain during the CP and in adults, to highlight processes that might confer adaptive advantage. In addition, we directly compare deprivation-induced cortical plasticity during the CP and plasticity following acute injury or ischemia in mature brain. We find that these two processes display a biphasic response profile following deprivation or injury: an initial decrease in GABAergic inhibition and synapse loss transitions into a period of neurite expansion and synaptic gain. This biphasic response profile emphasizes the transition from a period of cortical healing to one of reconnection and recovery of function. Yet while injury-induced plasticity in adult shares several salient characteristics with deprivation-induced plasticity during the CP, the degree to which the adult injured brain is able to functionally rewire, and the time required to do so, present major limitations for recovery. Attempts to recapitulate a measure of CP plasticity in an adult injury context will need to carefully dissect the circuit alterations and plasticity mechanisms involved while measuring functional behavioral output to assess their ultimate success.

      "Plasticity constitutes the basis of behavioral changes as a result of experience. It refers to neural network shaping and re-shaping at the global level and to synaptic contacts remodeling at the local level, either during learning or memory encoding, or as a result of acute or chronic pathological conditions. 'Plastic' brain reorganization after central nervous system lesions has a pivotal role in the recovery and rehabilitation of sensory and motor dysfunction, but can also be \"\"maladaptive\"\". Moreover, it is clear that brain reorganization is not a \"\"static\"\" phenomenon but rather a very dynamic process. Spinal cord injury immediately initiates a change in brain state and starts cortical reorganization. In the long term, the impact of injury - with or without accompanying therapy - on the brain is a complex balance between supraspinal reorganization and spinal recovery. The degree of cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury is highly variable, and can range from no reorganization (i.e. \"\"silencing\"\") to massive cortical remapping. This variability critically depends on the species, the age of the animal when the injury occurs, the time after the injury has occurred, and the behavioral activity and possible therapy regimes after the injury. We will briefly discuss these dependencies, trying to highlight their translational value. Overall, it is not only necessary to better understand how the brain can reorganize after injury with or without therapy, it is also necessary to clarify when and why brain reorganization can be either \"\"good\"\" or \"\"bad\"\" in terms of its clinical consequences. This information is critical in order to develop and optimize cost-effective therapies to maximize functional recovery while minimizing maladaptive states after spinal cord injury.

      "To present the result and experience of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. Case series. Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. A cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease received subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation from September 1998 to January 2010. Patient assessment data before and after the operation were collected prospectively. Forty-one patients (21 male and 20 female) with Parkinson's disease underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and were followed up for a median interval of 12 months. For the whole group, the mean improvements of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts II and III were 32.5% and 31.5%, respectively (P<0.001). Throughout the years, a multidisciplinary team was gradually built. The deep brain stimulation protocol evolved and was substantiated by updated patient selection criteria and outcome assessment, integrated imaging and neurophysiological targeting, refinement of surgical technique as well as the accumulation of experience in deep brain stimulation programming. Most of the structural improvement occurred before mid-2005. Patients receiving the operation before June 2005 (19 cases) and after (22 cases) were compared; the improvements in UPDRS part III were 13.2% and 55.2%, respectively (P<0.001). There were three operative complications (one lead migration, one cerebral haematoma, and one infection) in the group operated on before 2005. There was no operative mortality. The functional state of Parkinson's disease patients with motor disabilities refractory to best medical treatment improved significantly after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. A dedicated multidisciplinary team building, refined protocol for patient selection and assessment, improvement of targeting methods, meticulous surgical technique, and experience in programming are the key factors contributing to the improved outcome. 1098852983\n",

      "To compare the intraoperative complications and safety of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Single center. Prospective consecutive comparative cohort case series. Eyes had femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (study group) or phacoemulsification (control group) by 1 of 5 surgeons. The technique comprised manual corneal incisions and capsulorhexis or laser-assisted anterior capsulotomy, lens fragmentation, corneal incisions, phacoemulsification, and intraocular lens implantation. The study group comprised 1852 eyes and the control group, 2228 eyes. Patient demographics were similar between groups. There was a significant improvement in vacuum/docking attempts, surface recognition adjustments, treatment, and vacuum time during the laser procedure in the study group. Anterior capsule tears occurred in 1.84% of eyes in the study group and 0.22% of eyes in the control group (P < .0001). There was no difference in the incidence of anterior capsule tears between the first half and second half of laser-assisted cases. Anterior capsulotomy tags occurred in 1.62% study group eyes. There was no significant difference in posterior capsule tears between the 2 groups (0.43% versus 0.18%). The incidence of significant intraoperative corneal haze and miosis was higher and the effective phacoemulsification time significantly lower in the study group (P < .001). Significant intraoperative complications likely to affect refractive outcomes and patient satisfaction were low overall. The 2 cataract surgery techniques appear to be equally safe. Although anterior capsule tears remain a concern, the safety of femtosecond-assisted cataract surgery in terms of posterior capsule complications was equal to that of phacoemulsification.

      "The DNA unwinding element (DUE)-binding protein (DUE-B) binds to replication origins coordinately with the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase and the helicase activator Cdc45 in vivo, and loads Cdc45 onto chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts. Human DUE-B also retains the aminoacyl-tRNA proofreading function of its shorter orthologs in lower organisms. Here we report that phosphorylation of the DUE-B unstructured C-terminal domain unique to higher organisms regulates DUE-B intermolecular binding. Gel filtration analyses show that unphosphorylated DUE-B forms multiple high molecular weight (HMW) complexes. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and Mcm2-7 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry of the HMW complexes. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase binding is RNase A sensitive, whereas interaction with Mcm2-7 is nuclease resistant. Unphosphorylated DUE-B HMW complex formation is decreased by PP2A inhibition or direct DUE-B phosphorylation, and increased by inhibition of Cdc7. These results indicate that the state of DUE-B phosphorylation is maintained by the equilibrium between Cdc7-dependent phosphorylation and PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation, each previously shown to regulate replication initiation. Alanine mutation of the DUE-B C-terminal phosphorylation target sites increases MCM binding but blocks Cdc45 loading in vivo and inhibits cell division. In egg extracts alanine mutation of the DUE-B C-terminal phosphorylation sites blocks Cdc45 loading and inhibits DNA replication. The effects of DUE-B C-terminal phosphorylation reveal a novel S phase kinase regulatory mechanism for Cdc45 loading and MCM helicase activation.

      "VanX is a d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) dipeptidase encoded in the vancomycin-resistance vanA gene cluster. Here we report that strong bacteriolysis occurred when isolated VanX was expressed in Escherichia coli at temperatures lower than 30 degC, which was unexpected because the vanA operon confers vancomycin resistance by protecting the cell wall. Therefore, we monitored cell lysis by measuring sample turbidity with absorbance at 590 nm and VanX expression using SDS-PAGE. No cell lysis was observed when VanX was expressed, even in large quantities, in the cell inclusion bodies at 37 degC, suggesting that a natively folded VanX is required for lysis. In addition, VanX mutants with suppressed dipeptidase activity did not lyse E. coli cells, confirming that bacteriolysis originated from the dipeptidase activity of VanX. We also observed shape changes in E. coli cells undergoing VanX-mediated lysis with optical microscopy and classified these changes into three classes: bursting, deformation, and leaking fluid. Optical microscopic image analysis fully corroborated our interpretation of the turbidity changes in the samples. From a practical perspective, the finding that VanX expressed in isolation induces cell lysis suggests that inhibitors of VanA and VanH that act downstream from VanX could provide a new class of therapeutic chemicals against bacteria expressing the vancomycin-resistance gene cluster.

      "The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in developmental processes, including embryonic patterning, cell specification, and cell polarity. Wnt components participate in the development of the central nervous system, and growing evidence indicates that this pathway also regulates the function of the adult nervous system. In this study, we report that Wnt-5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, is a potent activator of mitochondrial dynamics and induces acute fission and fusion events in the mitochondria of rat hippocampal neurons. The effect of Wnt-5a was inhibited in the presence of sFRP, a Wnt scavenger. Similarly, the canonical Wnt-3a ligand had no effect on mitochondrial fission-fusion events, suggesting that this effect is specific for Wnt-5a alone. We also show that the Wnt-5a effects on mitochondrial dynamics occur with an increase in both intracellular and mitochondrial calcium (Ca(2+)), which was correlated with an increased phosphorylation of Drp1(Ser-616) and a decrease of Ser-637 phosphorylation, both indicators of mitochondrial dynamics. Electron microscope analysis of hippocampal tissues in the CA1 region showed an increase in the number of mitochondria present in the postsynaptic region, and this finding correlated with a change in mitochondrial morphology. We conclude that Wnt-5a/Ca(2+) signaling regulates the mitochondrial fission-fusion process in hippocampal neurons, a feature that might help to further understand the role of Wnt-related pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, and represents a potentially important link between impaired metabolic function and degenerative disorders.

      "Glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are sensitive to nutritional state, and the net direction of flux is controlled by multiple enzymatic steps. This delicate balance in the liver is disrupted by a variety of pathological states including cancer and diabetes mellitus. Hyperpolarized carbon-13 magnetic resonance is a new metabolic imaging technique that can probe intermediary metabolism nondestructively. There are currently no methods to rapidly distinguish livers in a gluconeogenic from glycogenolytic state. Here we use the gluconeogenic precursor dihydroxyacetone (DHA) to deliver hyperpolarized carbon-13 to the perfused mouse liver. DHA enters gluconeogenesis at the level of the trioses. Perfusion conditions were designed to establish either a gluconeogenic or a glycogenolytic state. Unexpectedly, we found that [2-(13)C]DHA was metabolized within a few seconds to the common intermediates and end products of both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis under both conditions, including [2,5-(13)C]glucose, [2-(13)C]glycerol 3-phosphate, [2-(13)C]phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), [2-(13)C]pyruvate, [2-(13)C]alanine, and [2-(13)C]lactate. [2-(13)C]Phosphoenolpyruvate, a key branch point in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, was monitored in functioning tissue for the first time. Observation of [2-(13)C]PEP was not anticipated as the free energy difference between PEP and pyruvate is large. Pyruvate kinase is the only regulatory step of the common glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway that appears to exert significant control over the kinetics of any metabolites of DHA. A ratio of glycolytic to gluconeogenic products distinguished the gluconeogenic from glycogenolytic state in these functioning livers.

      "As a large double-stranded DNA virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) assembles capsids in the nucleus where the viral particles exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. Although a number of viral and host proteins are involved, the machinery of viral egress is not well understood. In a search for host interacting proteins of ICP34.5, which is a virulence factor of HSV-1, we identified a cellular protein, p32 (gC1qR/HABP1), by mass spectrophotometer analysis. When expressed, ICP34.5 associated with p32 in mammalian cells. Upon HSV-1 infection, p32 was recruited to the inner nuclear membrane by ICP34.5, which paralleled the phosphorylation and rearrangement of nuclear lamina. Knockdown of p32 in HSV-1-infected cells significantly reduced the production of cell-free viruses, suggesting that p32 is a mediator of HSV-1 nuclear egress. These observations suggest that the interaction between HSV-1 ICP34.5 and p32 leads to the disintegration of nuclear lamina and facilitates the nuclear egress of HSV-1 particles.

      "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous inherited degenerative retinopathies caused by abnormalities of photoreceptors or retinal pigment epithelium in the retina leading to progressive sight loss. Rhodopsin is the prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor located in the vertebrate retina and is responsible for dim light vision. Here, novel M39R and N55K variants were identified as causing an intriguing sector phenotype of RP in affected patients, with selective degeneration in the inferior retina. To gain insights into the molecular aspects associated with this sector RP phenotype, whose molecular mechanism remains elusive, the mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in heterologous systems, and studied by biochemical, spectroscopic, and functional assays. M39R and N55K opsins had variable degrees of chromophore regeneration when compared with WT opsin but showed no gross structural misfolding or altered trafficking. M39R showed a faster rate for transducin activation than WT rhodopsin with a faster metarhodopsinII decay, whereas N55K presented a reduced activation rate and an altered photobleaching pattern. N55K also showed an altered retinal release from the opsin binding pocket upon light exposure, affecting its optimal functional response. Our data suggest that these sector RP mutations cause different protein phenotypes that may be related to their different clinical progression. Overall, these findings illuminate the molecular mechanisms of sector RP associated with rhodopsin mutations.

      "Genetic mutations in osteoclastogenic genes are closely associated with osteopetrotic bone diseases. Genetic defects in OSTM1 (osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1) cause autosomal recessive osteopetrosis in humans. In particular, OSTM1 mutations that exclude the transmembrane domain might lead to the production of a secreted form of truncated OSTM1. However, the precise role of the secreted form of truncated OSTM1 remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the functional role of truncated OSTM1 in osteoclastogenesis. Here, we showed that a secreted form of truncated OSTM1 binds to the cell surface of osteoclast (OC) precursors and inhibits the formation of multinucleated OCs through the reduction of cell fusion and survival. Truncated OSTM1 significantly inhibited the expression of OC marker genes through the down-regulation of the BLIMP1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1)-NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells c1) axis. Finally, we demonstrated that truncated OSTM1 reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced bone destruction in vivo. Thus, these findings suggest that autosomal recessive osteopetrosis patients with an OSTM1 gene mutation lacking the transmembrane domain produce a secreted form of truncated OSTM1 that inhibits osteoclastogenesis.

      "Exopolysaccharides are required for the development and integrity of biofilms produced by a wide variety of bacteria. In staphylococci, partial de-N-acetylation of the exopolysaccharide poly-b-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) by the extracellular protein IcaB is required for biofilm formation. To understand the molecular basis for PNAG de-N-acetylation, the structure of IcaB from Ammonifex degensii (IcaBAd) has been determined to 1.7 A resolution. The structure of IcaBAd reveals a (b/a)7 barrel common to the family four carbohydrate esterases (CE4s) with the canonical motifs circularly permuted. The metal dependence of IcaBAd is similar to most CE4s showing the maximum rates of de-N-acetylation with Ni(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+). From docking studies with b-1,6-GlcNAc oligomers and structural comparison to PgaB from Escherichia coli, the Gram-negative homologue of IcaB, we identify Arg-45, Tyr-67, and Trp-180 as key residues for PNAG binding during catalysis. The absence of these residues in PgaB provides a rationale for the requirement of a C-terminal domain for efficient deacetylation of PNAG in Gram-negative species. Mutational analysis of conserved active site residues suggests that IcaB uses an altered catalytic mechanism in comparison to other characterized CE4 members. Furthermore, we identified a conserved surface-exposed hydrophobic loop found only in Gram-positive homologues of IcaB. Our data suggest that this loop is required for membrane association and likely anchors IcaB to the membrane during polysaccharide biosynthesis. The work presented herein will help guide the design of IcaB inhibitors to combat biofilm formation by staphylococci.

      "Although ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, only a small fraction of patients benefit from the current thrombolytic therapy due to a risk of cerebral hemorrhage caused by inflammation. Thus, the development of a new strategy to combat inflammation during thrombolysis is an urgent demand. The small molecule thrombolytic SMTP-7 effectively treats ischemic stroke in several animal models with reducing cerebral hemorrhage. Here we revealed that SMTP-7 targeted soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to suppress inflammation. SMTP-7 inhibited both of the two sEH enzyme activities: epoxide hydrolase (which inactivates anti-inflammatory epoxy-fatty acids) and lipid phosphate phosphatase. SMTP-7 suppressed epoxy-fatty acid hydrolysis in HepG2 cells in culture, implicating the sEH inhibition in the anti-inflammatory mechanism. The sEH inhibition by SMTP-7 was independent of its thrombolytic activity. The simultaneous targeting of thrombolysis and sEH by a single molecule is a promising strategy to revolutionize the current stroke therapy.

      "Prenylated flavonoids are attractive specialized metabolites with a wide range of biological activities and are distributed in several plant families. The prenylation catalyzed by prenyltransferases represents a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the flavonoid skeleton in the biosynthesis of natural prenylated flavonoids and contributes to the structural diversity and biological activities of these compounds. To date, all identified plant flavonoid prenyltransferases (FPTs) have been identified in Leguminosae. In the present study two new FPTs, Morus alba isoliquiritigenin 3'-dimethylallyltransferase (MaIDT) and Cudrania tricuspidata isoliquiritigenin 3'-dimethylallyltransferase (CtIDT), were identified from moraceous plants M. alba and C. tricuspidata, respectively. MaIDT and CtIDT shared low levels of homology with the leguminous FPTs. MaIDT and CtIDT are predicted to be membrane-bound proteins with predicted transit peptides, seven transmembrane regions, and conserved functional domains that are similar to other homogentisate prenyltransferases. Recombinant MaIDT and CtIDT were able to regioselectively introduce dimethylallyl diphosphate into the A ring of three flavonoids with different skeleton types (chalcones, isoflavones, and flavones). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MaIDT and CtIDT are distantly related to their homologs in Leguminosae, which suggests that FPTs in Moraceae and Leguminosae might have evolved independently. MaIDT and CtIDT represent the first two non-Leguminosae FPTs to be identified in plants and could thus lead to the identification of additional evolutionarily varied FPTs in other non-Leguminosae plants and could elucidate the biosyntheses of prenylated flavonoids in various plants. Furthermore, MaIDT and CtIDT might be used for regiospecific prenylation of flavonoids to produce bioactive compounds for potential therapeutic applications due to their high efficiency and catalytic promiscuity.

In this study, we investigated whether Grx2 gene deletion could induce faster age-related cataract formation and elucidated the biochemical changes effected by Grx2 gene deletion that may contribute to lens opacity. Slit lamp was used to examine the lenses in Grx2 knock-out (KO) mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice ages 1 to 16 months. In the Grx2 null mice, the lens nuclear opacity began at 5 months, 3 months sooner than that of the control mice, and the progression of cataracts was also much faster than the age-matched controls. Lenses of KO mice contained lower levels of protein thiols and GSH with a significant accumulation of S-glutathionylated proteins. Actin, aA-crystallin, and bB2-crystallin were identified by Western blot and mass spectroscopy as the major S-glutathionylated proteins in the lenses of 16-month-old Grx2 KO mice. Compared with the WT control, the lens of Grx2 KO mice had only 50% of the activity in complex I and complex IV and less than 10% of the ATP pool. It was concluded that Grx2 gene deletion altered the function of lens structural proteins through S-glutathionylation and also caused severe disturbance in mitochondrial function. These combined alterations affected lens transparency. (c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. SP2fUHnG@126.com\n",

      "Molting fluid accumulates between the old and new cuticles during periodical ecdysis in Ecdysozoa. Natural defects in insect ecdysis are frequently associated with melanization (an immunity response) occurring primarily in molting fluids, suggesting that molting fluid may impact immunity as well as affect ecdysis. To address this hypothesis, proteomic analysis of molting fluids from Bombyx mori during three different types of ecdysis was performed. Many proteins were newly identified, including immunity-related proteins, in each molting fluid. Molting fluids inhibited the growth of bacteria in vitro. The entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana, which can escape immune responses in feeding larvae, is quickly recognized by larvae during ecdysis, followed by melanization in molting fluid and old cuticle. Fungal conidia germination was delayed, and no hyphae were detected in the hemocoels of pharate instar insects. Molting fluids protect the delicate pharate instar insects with extremely thin cuticles against microorganisms. To explore the function of molting fluids in ecdysis regulation, based on protein similarity, 32 genes were selected for analysis in ecdysis regulation through RNAi in Tribolium castaneum, a model commonly used to study integument development because RNAi is difficult to achieve in B. mori. We identified 24 molting proteins that affected ecdysis after knockdown, with different physiological functions, including old cuticle protein recycling, molting fluid pressure balance, detoxification, and signal detection and transfer of molting fluids. We report that insects secrete molting fluid for protection and regulation of ecdysis, which indicates a way to develop new pesticides through interrupting insect ecdysis in the future.

      "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with diverse genetic alterations including mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Isoliquiritigenin (ILQ), a chalcone derivative, possesses anticancer activities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ILQ on the growth of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells and elucidated its underlying mechanisms. Treatment with ILQ inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in both TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells. ILQ-induced apoptosis was associated with the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, increased expression of Bim, and reduced expression of Bcl-2. In vitro kinase assay results revealed that ILQ inhibited the catalytic activity of both wild type and double mutant (L858R/T790M) EGFR. Treatment with ILQ inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with either wild type or double-mutant EGFR with or without EGF stimulation. ILQ also reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in both TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells, and attenuated the kinase activity of Akt1 and ERK2 in vitro. ILQ directly interacted with both wild type and double-mutant EGFR in an ATP-competitive manner. A docking model study showed that ILQ formed two hydrogen bonds (Glu-762 and Met-793) with wild type EGFR and three hydrogen bonds (Lys-745, Met-793, and Asp-855) with mutant EGFR. ILQ attenuated the xenograft tumor growth of H1975 cells, which was associated with decreased expression of Ki-67 and diminished phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2.

      "Ascl2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a downstream target of WNT signaling that controls the fate of intestinal cryptic stem cells and colon cancer progenitor cells. However, its involvement in colon cancer and downstream molecular events is largely undefined; in particular, the mechanism by which Ascl2 regulates the plasticity of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) programs in colon cancer cells remains unknown. In this study, we systematically demonstrate that Ascl2 loss of function in colon cancer cells promotes MET by derepressing the expression of microRNA (miR)-200s (i.e. miR-200b, miR-200a, miR-429, miR-200c, and miR-141) and further activating their expression through a transcriptional mechanism that involves direct binding to the most proximal E-box (E-box2) in the miR-200b-a-429 promoter. Activation of miR-200s due to Ascl2 deficiency led to the inhibition of ZEB1/2 expression and the alteration of epithelial and mesenchymal features. Transfection of miR-200b, miR-200a, and miR-429 inhibitors into Ascl2-deficient colon cancer cells promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a reversible manner. Transfection of miR-200a or miR-429 inhibitors into Ascl2-deficient colon cancer cells increased cellular proliferation and migration. Ascl2 mRNA levels and the miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, or miR-429 levels in the colon cancerous samples were inversely correlated. These results provide the first evidence of a link between Ascl2 and miR-200s in the regulation of EMT-MET plasticity in colon cancer.

      "Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domains are short sequence motifs that mediate nearly all protein-protein interactions between B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins in the intrinsic apoptotic cell death pathway. These sequences are found on both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members, although their primary function is believed to be associated with induction of cell death. Here, we identify critical features of the BH3 domains of pro-survival proteins that distinguish them functionally from their pro-apoptotic counterparts. Biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies demonstrate that these differences reduce the capacity of most pro-survival proteins to form high affinity \"\"BH3-in-groove\"\" complexes that are critical for cell death induction. Switching these residues for the corresponding residues in Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) increases the binding affinity of isolated BH3 domains for pro-survival proteins; however, their exchange in the context of the parental protein causes rapid proteasomal degradation due to protein destabilization. This is supported by further x-ray crystallographic studies that capture elements of this destabilization in one pro-survival protein, Bcl-w. In pro-apoptotic Bak, we demonstrate that the corresponding distinguishing residues are important for its cell-killing capacity and antagonism by pro-survival proteins.

      "Bacterial meningitis occurs when bloodborne pathogens invade and penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), provoking inflammation and disease. Group B Streptococcus (GBS), the leading cause of neonatal meningitis, can enter human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), but the host response to intracellular GBS has not been characterized. Here we sought to determine whether antibacterial autophagy, which involves selective recognition of intracellular organisms and their targeting to autophagosomes for degradation, is activated in BBB endothelium during bacterial infection. GBS infection resulted in increased punctate distribution of GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and increased levels of endogenous LC3-II and p62 turnover, two hallmark indicators of active autophagic flux. Infection with GBS mutants revealed that bacterial invasion and the GBS pore-forming b-hemolysin/cytolysin (b-h/c) trigger autophagic activation. Cell-free bacterial extracts containing b-h/c activity induced LC3-II conversion, identifying this toxin as a principal provocative factor for autophagy activation. These results were confirmed in vivo using a mouse model of GBS meningitis as infection with WT GBS induced autophagy in brain tissue more frequently than a b-h/c-deficient mutant. Elimination of autophagy using Atg5-deficient fibroblasts or siRNA-mediated impairment of autophagy in hBMECs led to increased recovery of intracellular GBS. However, electron microscopy revealed that GBS was rarely found within double membrane autophagic structures even though we observed GBS-LC3 co-localization. These results suggest that although autophagy may act as a BBB cellular defense mechanism in response to invading and toxin-producing bacteria, GBS may actively thwart the autophagic pathway.

      "Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS) is the first pathway-specific enzyme in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins, the most widely used plant-derived pesticide. CDS catalyzes c1'-2-3 cyclopropanation reactions of two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to yield chrysanthemyl diphosphate (CPP). Three proteins are known to catalyze this cyclopropanation reaction of terpene precursors. Two of them, phytoene and squalene synthase, are bifunctional enzymes with both prenyltransferase and terpene synthase activity. CDS, the other member, has been reported to perform only the prenyltransferase step. Here we show that the NDXXD catalytic motif of CDS, under the lower substrate conditions prevalent in plants, also catalyzes the next step, converting CPP into chrysanthemol by hydrolyzing the diphosphate moiety. The enzymatic hydrolysis reaction followed conventional Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km value for CPP of 196 mm. For the chrysanthemol synthase activity, DMAPP competed with CPP as substrate. The DMAPP concentration required for half-maximal activity to produce chrysanthemol was ~100 mm, and significant substrate inhibition was observed at elevated DMAPP concentrations. The N-terminal peptide of CDS was identified as a plastid-targeting peptide. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing CDS emitted chrysanthemol at a rate of 0.12-0.16 mg h(-1) g(-1) fresh weight. We propose that CDS should be renamed a chrysanthemol synthase utilizing DMAPP as substrate. (c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. XoGlFqX@qq.com\n",

      "Protein kinase B (Akt) is a key effector of multiple cellular processes, including cell survival. Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, is known to increase cell survival by regulation of the intrinsic pathway for apoptosis. In this study, we found that Akt modulated the mevalonate pathway, which is also linked to cell survival, by increasing Rho GTPase activation. Akt modulated the pathway by phosphorylating mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) at Ser(96). This phosphorylation in macrophages increased activation of Rac1, which enhanced macrophage survival because mutation of MDD (MDDS96A) induced apoptosis. Akt-mediated activation in macrophages was specific for Rac1 because Akt did not increase activity of other Rho GTP-binding proteins. The relationship between Akt and Rac1 was biologically relevant because Akt(+/-) mice had significantly less active Rac1 in alveolar macrophages, and macrophages from Akt(+/-) mice had an increase in active caspase-9 and -3. More importantly, Akt(+/-) mice were significantly protected from the development of pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that macrophage survival is associated with the fibrotic phenotype. These observations for the first time suggest that Akt plays a critical role in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis by enhancing macrophage survival via modulation of the mevalonate pathway.

      "Signal transduction via NFkB and MAP kinase cascades is a universal response initiated upon pathogen recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). How activation of these divergent signaling pathways is integrated to dictate distinct immune responses to diverse pathogens is still incompletely understood. Herein, contrary to current perception, we demonstrate that a signaling pathway defined by the inhibitor of kB kinase b (IKKb), MAP3 kinase tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2/MAP3K8), and MAP kinase ERK is differentially activated by TLRs. TLRs 2, 4, and 7 directly activate this inflammatory axis, inducing immediate ERK phosphorylation and early TNFa secretion. In addition to TLR adaptor proteins, IKKb-Tpl2-ERK activation by TLR4 is regulated by the TLR4 co-receptor CD14 and the tyrosine kinase Syk. Signals from TLRs 3 and 9 do not initiate early activation of IKKb-Tpl2-ERK pathway but instead induce delayed, NADPH-oxidase-dependent ERK phosphorylation and TNFa secretion via autocrine reactive oxygen species signaling. Unexpectedly, Tpl2 is an essential regulator of ROS production during TLR signaling. Overall, our study reveals distinct mechanisms activating a common inflammatory signaling cascade and delineates differences in MyD88-dependent signaling between endosomal TLRs 7 and 9. These findings further confirm the importance of Tpl2 in innate host defense mechanisms and also enhance our understanding of how the immune system tailors pathogen-specific gene expression patterns.

      "The anti-aging protein Klotho is a type 1 membrane protein produced predominantly in the distal convoluted tubule. The ectodomain of Klotho is cleaved and secreted into the urine to regulate several ion channels and transporters. Secreted Klotho (sKL) up-regulates the TRPV5 calcium channel from the cell exterior by removing sialic acids from N-glycan of the channel and inhibiting its endocytosis. Because TRPV5 and Klotho coexpress in the distal convoluted tubule, we investigated whether Klotho regulates TRPV5 action from inside the cell. Whole-cell TRPV5-mediated channel activity was recorded in HEK cells coexpressing TRPV5 and sKL or membranous Klotho (mKL). Transfection of sKL, but not mKL, produced detectable Klotho protein in cell culture media. As for sKL, mKL increased TRPV5 current density. The role of sialidase activity of mKL acting inside is supported by findings that mutations of putative sialidase activity sites in sKL and mKL abrogated the regulation of TRPV5 but that the extracellular application of a sialidase inhibitor prevented the regulation of TRPV5 by sKL only. Mechanistically, coexpression with a dominant-negative dynamin II prevented the regulation of TRPV5 by sKL but not by mKL. In contrast, blocking forward trafficking by brefeldin A prevented the effect with mKL but not with sKL. Therefore, Klotho up-regulates TRPV5 from both the inside and outside of cells. The intracellular action of Klotho is likely due to enhanced forward trafficking of channel proteins, whereas the extracellular action is due to inhibition of endocytosis. Both effects involve putative Klotho sialidase activity. These effects of Klotho may play important roles regarding calcium reabsorption in the kidney.

      "The proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin isozyme 1 (SKI-1)/site 1 protease (S1P) plays crucial roles in cellular homeostatic functions and is hijacked by pathogenic viruses for the processing of their envelope glycoproteins. Zymogen activation of SKI-1/S1P involves sequential autocatalytic processing of its N-terminal prodomain at sites B'/B followed by the herein newly identified C'/C sites. We found that SKI-1/S1P autoprocessing results in intermediates whose catalytic domain remains associated with prodomain fragments of different lengths. In contrast to other zymogen proprotein convertases, all incompletely matured intermediates of SKI-1/S1P showed full catalytic activity toward cellular substrates, whereas optimal cleavage of viral glycoproteins depended on B'/B processing. Incompletely matured forms of SKI-1/S1P further process cellular and viral substrates in distinct subcellular compartments. Using a cell-based sensor for SKI-1/S1P activity, we found that 9 amino acid residues at the cleavage site (P1-P8) and P1' are necessary and sufficient to define the subcellular location of processing and to determine to what extent processing of a substrate depends on SKI-1/S1P maturation. In sum, our study reveals novel and unexpected features of SKI-1/S1P zymogen activation and subcellular specificity of activity toward cellular and pathogen-derived substrates.

      "Aha1 (activator of Hsp90 ATPase) stimulates the ATPase activity of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 to accelerate the conformational cycle during which client proteins attain their final shape. Thereby, Aha1 promotes effective folding of Hsp90-dependent clients such as steroid receptors and many kinases involved in cellular signaling. In our current study, we find that Aha1 plays a novel, additional role beyond regulating the Hsp90 ATP hydrolysis rate. We propose a new concept suggesting that Aha1 acts as an autonomous chaperone and associates with stress-denatured proteins to prevent them from aggregation similar to the chaperonin GroEL. Our study reveals that an N-terminal sequence of 22 amino acids, present in human but absent from yeast Aha1, is critical for this capability. However, in lieu of fostering their refolding, Aha1 allows ubiquitination of bound clients by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Accordingly, Aha1 may promote disposal of folding defective proteins by the cellular protein quality control.

      "Our previous study demonstrated that the NGX6b gene acts as a suppressor in the invasion and migration of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Recently, we identified the novel isoform NGX6a, which is longer than NGX6b. In this study, we first found that NGX6a was degraded in NPC cells and that this degradation was mediated by ezrin, a linker between membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton. Specific siRNAs against ezrin increase the protein level of NGX6a in these cells. During degradation, NGX6a is not ubiquitinated but is degraded through a proteasome-dependent pathway. The distribution pattern of ezrin was negatively associated with NGX6a in an immunochemistry analysis of a nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue microarray and fetus multiple organ tissues and Western blot analysis in nasopharyngeal and NPC cell lines, suggesting that ezrin and NGX6a are associated and are involved in the progression and invasion of NPC. By mapping the interacting binding sites, the seven-transmembrane domain of NGX6a was found to be the critical region for the degradation of NGX6a, and the amino terminus of ezrin is required for the induction of NGX6a degradation. The knockdown of ezrin or transfection of the NGX6a mutant CO, which has an EGF-like domain and a transmembrane 1 domain, resulted in no degradation, significantly reducing the ability of invasion and migration of NPC cells. This study provides a novel molecular mechanism for the low expression of NGX6a in NPC cells and an important molecular event in the process of invasion and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.

      "High levels of metabolic activity confer resistance to apoptosis. Caspase-2, an apoptotic initiator, can be suppressed by high levels of nutrient flux through the pentose phosphate pathway. This metabolic control is exerted via inhibitory phosphorylation of the caspase-2 prodomain by activated Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). We show here that this activation of CaMKII depends, in part, on dephosphorylation of CaMKII at novel sites (Thr(393)/Ser(395)) and that this is mediated by metabolic activation of protein phosphatase 2A in complex with the B55b targeting subunit. This represents a novel locus of CaMKII control and also provides a mechanism contributing to metabolic control of apoptosis. These findings may have implications for metabolic control of the many CaMKII-controlled and protein phosphatase 2A-regulated physiological processes, because both enzymes appear to be responsive to alterations in glucose metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway.

The stress-inducible protein Sestrin2 (Sesn2) plays an important role in maintaining redox and metabolic homeostasis and their related pathologies. However, the role of Sesn2 in cancer remains unclear. Here we show that UVB radiation induces Sesn2 expression in normal human keratinocytes, mouse skin, normal human melanocytes, and melanoma cells. In addition, Sesn2 promotes AKT activation through a PTEN-dependent mechanism. Sesn2 deletion or knockdown sensitizes squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis and melanoma cells to UVB- and vemurafenib-induced apoptosis. In mice Sesn2 knockdown suppresses tumor growth from injected human SCC and melanoma cells. Last, as compared with normal skin, Sesn2 is up-regulated in both human skin SCC and melanoma. Our findings demonstrate that Sesn2 promotes AKT activation and survival in response to UVB stress and chemotherapeutics and suggest that Sesn2 is oncogenic in skin SCC and melanoma.

      "Group A Streptococcus (GAS) responds to subinhibitory concentrations of LL-37 by up-regulation of virulence factors through the CsrRS (CovRS) two-component system. The signaling mechanism, however, is unclear. To determine whether LL-37 signaling reflects specific binding to CsrS or rather a nonspecific response to LL-37-mediated membrane damage, we tested LL-37 fragments for CsrRS signaling and for GAS antimicrobial activity. We identified a 10-residue fragment (RI-10) of LL-37 as the minimal peptide that retains the ability to signal increased expression of GAS virulence factors, yet it has no detectable antimicrobial activity against GAS. Substitution of individual key amino acids in RI-10 reduced or abrogated signaling. These data do not support the hypothesis that CsrS detects LL-37-induced damage to the bacterial cell membrane but rather suggest that LL-37 signaling is mediated by a direct interaction with CsrS. To test whether LL-37 binds to CsrS, we used the purified CsrS extracellular domain to pull down LL-37 in vitro, a result that provides further evidence that LL-37 binds to CsrS. The dissociation of CsrS-mediated signaling from membrane damage by LL-37 fragments together with in vitro evidence for a direct LL-37-CsrS binding interaction constitute compelling evidence that signal transduction by LL-37 through CsrS reflects a direct ligand/receptor interaction.

The ability to predict residues of the RdRp required for faithful incorporation of nucleotides represents an essential step in any pipeline intended to exploit perturbed fidelity as the basis for rational design of vaccine candidates. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and pre-steady-state kinetics to compare a mutator (H273R) RdRp from poliovirus to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. We show that the nucleotide-binding site toggles between the nucleotide binding-occluded and nucleotide binding-competent states. The conformational dynamics between these states were enhanced by binding to primed template RNA. For the WT, the occluded conformation was favored; for H273R, the competent conformation was favored. The resonance for Met-187 in our NMR spectra reported on the ability of the enzyme to check the correctness of the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments were consistent with the conformational dynamics contributing to the established pre-incorporation conformational change and fidelity checkpoint. For H273R, residues comprising the active site spent more time in the catalytically competent conformation and were more positively correlated than the WT. We propose that by linking the equilibrium between the binding-occluded and binding-competent conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket and other active-site dynamics to the correctness of the bound nucleotide, faithful nucleotide incorporation is achieved. These studies underscore the need to apply multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches to the elucidation of the physical basis for polymerase fidelity.

      "The non-receptor isoform of protein-tyrosine phosphatase [?] (cyt-PTPe) supports adhesion of bone-resorbing osteoclasts by activating Src downstream of integrins. Loss of cyt-PTPe reduces Src activity in osteoclasts, reduces resorption of mineralized matrix both in vivo and in cell culture, and induces mild osteopetrosis in young female PTPe KO mice. Activation of Src by cyt-PTPe is dependent upon this phosphatase undergoing phosphorylation at its C-terminal Tyr-638 by partially active Src. To understand how cyt-PTPe activates Src, we screened 73 Src homology 2 (SH2) domains for binding to Tyr(P)-638 of cyt-PTPe. The SH2 domain of GRB2 bound Tyr(P)-638 of cyt-PTPe most prominently, whereas the Src SH2 domain did not bind at all, suggesting that GRB2 may link PTPe with downstream molecules. Further studies indicated that GRB2 is required for activation of Src by cyt-PTPe in osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) in culture. Overexpression of GRB2 in OCLs increased activating phosphorylation of Src at Tyr-416 and of cyt-PTPe at Tyr-638; opposite results were obtained when GRB2 expression was reduced by shRNA or by gene inactivation. Phosphorylation of cyt-PTPe at Tyr-683 and its association with GRB2 are integrin-driven processes in OCLs, and cyt-PTPe undergoes autodephosphorylation at Tyr-683, thus limiting Src activation by integrins. Reduced GRB2 expression also reduced the ability of bone marrow precursors to differentiate into OCLs and reduced the fraction of OCLs in which podosomal adhesion structures assume organization typical of active, resorbing cells. We conclude that GRB2 physically links cyt-PTPe with Src and enables cyt-PTPe to activate Src downstream of activated integrins in OCLs.

      "Liver steatosis is a common health problem associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and an important risk factor for the development of liver fibrosis and cancer. Steatosis is caused by triglycerides (TG) accumulating in lipid droplets (LDs), cellular organelles composed of neutral lipids surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids. The HCV nucleocapsid core localizes to the surface of LDs and induces steatosis in cultured cells and mouse livers by decreasing intracellular TG degradation (lipolysis). Here we report that core at the surface of LDs interferes with the activity of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the key lipolytic enzyme in the first step of TG breakdown. Expressing core in livers or mouse embryonic fibroblasts of ATGL(-/-) mice no longer decreases TG degradation as observed in LDs from wild-type mice, supporting the model that core reduces lipolysis by engaging ATGL. Core must localize at LDs to inhibit lipolysis, as ex vivo TG hydrolysis is impaired in purified LDs coated with core but not when free core is added to LDs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that core does not directly interact with the ATGL complex but, unexpectedly, increased the interaction between ATGL and its activator CGI-58 as well as the recruitment of both proteins to LDs. These data link the anti-lipolytic activity of the HCV core protein with altered ATGL binding to CGI-58 and the enhanced association of both proteins with LDs.

In this work, we provide evidence to suggest, for the first time, that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tpa1 protein is involved in DNA alkylation repair. Little is known about Tpa1 as a repair protein beyond the initial observation from a high-throughput analysis indicating that deletion of TPA1 causes methyl methane sulfonate sensitivity in S. cerevisiae. Using purified Tpa1, we demonstrate that Tpa1 repairs both single- and double-stranded methylated DNA. Tpa1 is a member of the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family, and we show that mutation of the amino acid residues involved in cofactor binding abolishes the Tpa1 DNA repair activity. Deletion of TPA1 along with the base excision repair pathway DNA glycosylase MAG1 renders the tpa1Dmag1D double mutant highly susceptible to methylation-induced toxicity. We further demonstrate that the trans-lesion synthesis DNA polymerase Polz (REV3) plays a key role in tolerating DNA methyl-base lesions and that tpa1Dmag1revD3 triple mutant is extremely susceptible to methylation-induced toxicity. Our results indicate a synergism between the base excision repair pathway and direct alkylation repair by Tpa1 in S. cerevisiae. We conclude that Tpa1 is a hitherto unidentified DNA repair protein in yeast and that it plays a crucial role in reverting alkylated DNA base lesions and cytotoxicity.

It has been indicated previously that during a transglutaminase reaction activated factor XIII (FXIIIa) covalently cross-links von Willebrand factor (VWF) to polymerizing fibrin. Bound VWF further recruits and activates platelets via interactions with the platelet receptor complex glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). In the present study we found proof for binding of VWF to a fibrin monomer layer during the process of fibrinogen-to-fibrin conversion in the presence of thrombin, arvin, or a snake venom from Crotalus atrox. Using a domain deletion mutant we demonstrated the involvement of the C domains of VWF in this binding. Substantial binding of VWF to fibrin monomers persisted in the presence of the FXIIIa inhibitor K9-DON, illustrating that cross-linking via factor XIII is not essential for this phenomenon and suggesting the identification of a second mechanism through which VWF multimers incorporate into a fibrin network. Under high shear conditions, platelets were shown to adhere to fibrin only if VWF had been incorporated. In conclusion, our experiments show that the C domains of VWF and the E domain of fibrin monomers are involved in the incorporation of VWF during the polymerization of fibrin and that this incorporation fosters binding and activation of platelets. Fibrin thus is not an inert end product but partakes in further thrombus growth. Our findings help to elucidate the mechanism of thrombus growth and platelet adhesion under conditions of arterial shear rate.

Circadian changes in olfactory functions such as neuronal firing in the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory sensitivity have recently been identified, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We analyzed the temporal profiles of glycan structures in the mouse OB using a high-density microarray that includes 96 lectins, because glycoconjugates play important roles in the nervous system such as neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Sixteen lectin signals significantly fluctuated in the OB, and the intensity of all three that had high affinity for a1-2-fucose (a1-2Fuc) glycan in the microarray was higher during the nighttime. Histochemical analysis revealed that a1-2Fuc glycan is located in a diurnal manner in the lateral olfactory tract that comprises axon bundles of secondary olfactory neurons. The amount of a1-2Fuc glycan associated with the major target glycoprotein neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) varied in a diurnal fashion, although the mRNA and protein expression of Ncam1 did not. The mRNA and protein expression of Fut1, a a1-2-specific fucosyltransferase gene, was diurnal in the OB. Daily fluctuation of the a1-2Fuc glycan was obviously damped in homozygous Clock mutant mice with disrupted diurnal Fut1 expression, suggesting that the molecular clock governs rhythmic a1-2-fucosylation in secondary olfactory neurons. These findings suggest the possibility that the molecular clock is involved in the diurnal regulation of olfaction via a1-2-fucosylation in the olfactory system.

      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is due to a folding defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The most common mutation, DF508, prevents CFTR from trafficking to the apical plasma membrane. Here we show that activation of the PDK1/SGK1 signaling pathway with C4-ceramide (C4-CER), a non-toxic small molecule, functionally corrects the trafficking defect in both cultured CF cells and primary epithelial cell explants from CF patients. The mechanism of C4-CER action involves a series of mutual autophosphorylation and phosphorylation events between PDK1 and SGK1. Detailed mechanistic studies indicate that C4-CER initially induces autophosphorylation of SGK1 at Ser(422). SGK1[Ser(P)(422)] and C4-CER coincidently bind PDK1 and permit PDK1 to autophosphorylate at Ser(241). Then PDK1[Ser(P)(241)] phosphorylates SGK1[Ser(P)(422)] at Thr(256) to generate fully activated SGK1[Ser(422), Thr(P)(256)]. SGK1[Ser(P)(422),Thr(P)(256)] phosphorylates and inactivates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. DF508-CFTR is thus free to traffic to the plasma membrane. Importantly, C4-CER-mediated activation of both PDK1 and SGK1 is independent of the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Physiologically, C4-CER significantly increases maturation and stability of DF508-CFTR (t1/2 ~10 h), enhances cAMP-activated chloride secretion, and suppresses hypersecretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8). We suggest that candidate drugs for CF directed against the PDK1/SGK1 signaling pathway, such as C4-CER, provide a novel therapeutic strategy for a life-limiting disorder that affects one child, on average, each day.

We studied the effect of CO donors (CORMs) on Cx46 HCs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp and on Cx43 and Cx46 expressed in HeLa cells using a dye-uptake technique. CORM-2 inhibited Cx46 HC currents in a concentration-dependent manner. The C-terminal domain and intracellular Cys were not necessary for the inhibition. The effect of CORM-2 was not prevented by guanylyl-cyclase, protein kinase G, or thioredoxin inhibitors, and was not due to endocytosis of HCs. However, the effect of CORM-2 was reversed by reducing agents that act extracellularly. Additionally, CO inhibited dye uptake of HeLa cells expressing Cx43 or Cx46, and MCF-7 cells, which endogenously express Cx43 and Cx46. Because CORM-2 carbonylates Cx46 in vitro and induces conformational changes, a direct effect of that CO on Cx46 is possible. The inhibition of HCs could help to understand some of the biological actions of CO in physiological and pathological conditions.

      "The b1a subunit is a cytoplasmic component of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) complex that plays an essential role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. Here we investigate the role of the C-terminal end of this auxiliary subunit in the functional and structural communication between the DHPR and the Ca(2+) release channel (RyR1). Progressive truncation of the b1a C terminus showed that deletion of amino acid residues Gln(489) to Trp(503) resulted in a loss of depolarization-induced Ca(2+) release, a severe reduction of L-type Ca(2+) currents, and a lack of tetrad formation as evaluated by freeze-fracture analysis. However, deletion of this domain did not affect expression/targeting or density (Qmax) of the DHPR-a1S subunit to the plasma membrane. Within this motif, triple alanine substitution of residues Leu(496), Leu(500), and Trp(503), which are thought to mediate direct b1a-RyR1 interactions, weakened EC coupling but did not replicate the truncated phenotype. Therefore, these data demonstrate that an amino acid segment encompassing sequence (489)QVQVLTSLRRNLSFW(503) of b1a contains critical determinant(s) for the physical link of DHPR and RyR1, further confirming a direct correspondence between DHPR positioning and DHPR/RyR functional interactions. In addition, our data strongly suggest that the motif Leu(496)-Leu(500)-Trp(503) within the b1a C-terminal tail plays a nonessential role in the bidirectional DHPR/RyR1 signaling that supports skeletal-type EC coupling.

      "We previously reported that targeted overexpression of the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms in osteoblastic lineage cells in mice resulted in phenotypic changes, including dwarfism, rickets, osteomalacia, hypophosphatemia, increased serum parathyroid hormone, and increased levels of the phosphatonin FGF23 in serum and bone. This study examined the effects of genetically knocking out the FGF2HMW isoforms (HMWKO) on bone and phosphate homeostasis. HMWKO mice were not dwarfed and had significantly increased bone mineral density and bone mineral content in femurs and lumbar vertebrae when compared with the wild-type (WT) littermates. Micro-computed tomography analysis of femurs revealed increased trabecular bone volume, thickness, number, and connective tissue density with decreased trabecular spacing compared with WT. In addition, there was significantly decreased cortical porosity and increased cortical thickness and sub-periosteal area in femurs of HMWKO. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated increased osteoblast activity and diminished osteoclast activity in the HMWKO. In vitro bone marrow stromal cell cultures showed there was a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase-positive colony number at 1 week in HMWKO. At 3 weeks of culture, the mineralized area was also significantly increased. There was increased expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes and reduced expression of genes associated with impaired mineralization, including a significant reduction in Fgf23 and Sost mRNA. Normal serum phosphate and parathyroid hormone were observed in HMWKO mice. This study demonstrates a significant negative impact of HMWFGF2 on biological functions in bone and phosphate homeostasis in mice.

      "Endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, plays an important role in pulmonary hypertension (PH) in sickle cell disease (SCD). Our previous studies show that higher levels of placenta growth factor (PlGF), secreted by erythroid precursor cells, correlate with increased plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and other functional markers of PH in SCD. PlGF-mediated ET-1 expression occurs via activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a). However, relatively less is understood regarding how PlGF-mediated expression of HIF-1a and its downstream effector ET-1 are post-transcriptionally regulated. Herein, we show that PlGF treatment of endothelial cells resulted in reduced levels of miR-199a2, which targeted the 3'-UTR of HIF-1a mRNA and concomitantly led to augmented ET-1 expression. Plasma levels of miR-199a2 in SCD subjects were significantly lower with reciprocally high levels of plasma ET-1, unlike unaffected controls. This observation provided a molecular link between miR-199a2 and high levels of ET-1 in SCD. Furthermore, we show that miR-199a2 located in the DNM3os transcription unit was co-transcriptionally regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa). Binding of the latter to PPARa cis-elements in the promoter of DNM3os was demonstrated by promoter mutational analysis and ChIP. Additionally, we show that fenofibrate, a PPARa agonist, increased the expression of miR-199a2 and DNM3os; the former was responsible for reduced expression of HIF-1a and ET-1. In vivo studies of fenofibrate-fed Berkeley sickle mice resulted in increased levels of miR-199a2 and reduced levels of ET-1 in lung tissues. Our studies provide a potential therapeutic approach whereby fenofibrate-induced miR-199a2 expression can ameliorate PH by reduction of ET-1 levels.

      "The oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1) kinase belongs to the mammalian STE20-like kinase family. OSR1 is activated by with no lysine [K] (WNKs) kinases, and then it phosphorylates cation-coupled Cl-cotransporters, regulating ion homeostasis and cell volume in mammalian cells. However, the specific mechanisms of OSR1 activation remains poorly defined, largely due to its extremely low basal activity. Here, we dissect in detail the regulatory mechanisms of OSR1 activation from the aspects of autoinhibition, upstream kinase WNK, and the newly identified master regulator mouse protein-25 (MO25). Based on our structural and biochemical studies, we propose a \"\"double lock\"\" model, accounting for the tight autoinhibition of OSR1, an effect that has to be removed by WNK before MO25 further activates OSR1. Particularly, the conserved C-terminal (CCT) domain and aAL helix act together to strongly suppress OSR1 basal activity. WNKs bind to the CCT and trigger its conformational rearrangement to release the kinase domain of OSR1, allowing for MO25 binding and full activation. Finally, the regulatory mechanisms of OSR1 activation were further corroborated by cellular studies of OSR1-regulated cell volume control through WNK-OSR1 signaling pathway. Collectively, these results provide insights into the OSR1 kinase activation to facilitate further functional study.

      "Small noncoding microRNAs have emerged as important regulators of cellular processes, but their role in pancreatic beta cells has only started to be elucidated. Loss of pancreatic beta cells is a key factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and we have demonstrated that beta cell expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is increased in diabetes and causes beta cell apoptosis, whereas TXNIP deficiency is protective against diabetes. Recently, we found that TXNIP also impairs beta cell function by inducing microRNA (miR)-204. Interestingly, using INS-1 beta cells and primary islets, we have now discovered that expression of another microRNA, miR-200, is induced by TXNIP and by diabetes. Furthermore, we found that miR-200 targeted and decreased Zeb1 (zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1) and promoted beta cell apoptosis as measured by cleaved caspase-3 levels, Bax/Bcl2 ratio, and TUNEL. In addition, Zeb1 knockdown mimicked the miR-200 effects on beta cell apoptosis, suggesting that Zeb1 plays an important role in mediating miR-200 effects. Moreover, miR-200 increased beta cell expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, consistent with inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process thought to be involved in beta cell expansion. Thus, we have identified a novel TXNIP/miR-200/Zeb1/E-cadherin signaling pathway that, for the first time, links miR-200 to beta cell apoptosis and diabetes and also beta cell TXNIP to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, our results shed new light on the regulation and function of miR-200 in beta cells and show that TXNIP-induced microRNAs control various processes of beta cell biology.

      "The calcium-permeable ion channel TRPM2 is highly expressed in a number of cancers. In neuroblastoma, full-length TRPM2 (TRPM2-L) protected cells from moderate oxidative stress through increased levels of forkhead box transcription factor 3a (FOXO3a) and superoxide dismutase 2. Cells expressing the dominant negative short isoform (TRPM2-S) had reduced FOXO3a and superoxide dismutase 2 levels, reduced calcium influx in response to oxidative stress, and enhanced reactive oxygen species, leading to decreased cell viability. Here, in xenografts generated with SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably expressing TRPM2 isoforms, growth of tumors expressing TRPM2-S was significantly reduced compared with tumors expressing TRPM2-L. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1/2a was significantly reduced in TRPM2-S-expressing tumor cells as was expression of target proteins regulated by HIF-1/2a including those involved in glycolysis (lactate dehydrogenase A and enolase 2), oxidant stress (FOXO3a), angiogenesis (VEGF), mitophagy and mitochondrial function (BNIP3 and NDUFA4L2), and mitochondrial electron transport chain activity (cytochrome oxidase 4.1/4.2 in complex IV). The reduction in HIF-1/2a was mediated through both significantly reduced HIF-1/2a mRNA levels and increased levels of von Hippel-Lindau E3 ligase in TRPM2-S-expressing cells. Inhibition of TRPM2-L by pretreatment with clotrimazole or expression of TRPM2-S significantly increased sensitivity of cells to doxorubicin. Reduced survival of TRPM2-S-expressing cells after doxorubicin treatment was rescued by gain of HIF-1 or -2a function. These data suggest that TRPM2 activity is important for tumor growth and for cell viability and survival following doxorubicin treatment and that interference with TRPM2-L function may be a novel approach to reduce tumor growth through modulation of HIF-1/2a, mitochondrial function, and mitophagy.

      "Drosophila Fic (dFic) mediates AMPylation, a covalent attachment of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from ATP to hydroxyl side chains of protein substrates. Here, we identified the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP as a substrate for dFic and mapped the modification site to Thr-366 within the ATPase domain. The level of AMPylated BiP in Drosophila S2 cells is high during homeostasis, whereas the level of AMPylated BiP decreases upon the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Both dFic and BiP are transcriptionally activated upon ER stress, supporting the role of dFic in the unfolded protein response pathway. The inactive conformation of BiP is the preferred substrate for dFic, thus endorsing a model whereby AMPylation regulates the function of BiP as a chaperone, allowing acute activation of BiP by deAMPylation during an ER stress response. These findings not only present the first substrate of eukaryotic AMPylator but also provide a target for regulating the unfolded protein response, an emerging avenue for cancer therapy.

      "The b2-adrenergic receptor (b2AR) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor that mediates many hormonal responses, including cardiovascular and pulmonary function. b-Agonists used to combat hypercontractility in airway smooth muscle stimulate b2AR-dependent cAMP production that ultimately promotes airway relaxation. Chronic stimulation of the b2AR by long acting b-agonists used in the treatment of asthma can promote attenuated responsiveness to agonists and an increased frequency of fatal asthmatic attacks. b2AR desensitization to b-agonists is primarily mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and b-arrestins that attenuate receptor-Gs coupling and promote b2AR internalization and degradation. A biased agonist that can selectively stimulate Gs signaling without promoting receptor interaction with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and b-arrestins should serve as an advantageous asthma therapeutic. To identify such molecules, we screened ~50 lipidated peptides derived from the intracellular loops of the b2AR, known as pepducins. This screen revealed two classes of Gs-biased pepducins, receptor-independent and receptor-dependent, as well as several b-arrestin-biased pepducins. The receptor-independent Gs-biased pepducins operate by directly stimulating G protein activation. In contrast, receptor-dependent Gs-biased pepducins appear to stabilize a Gs-biased conformation of the b2AR that couples to Gs but does not undergo G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation or b-arrestin-mediated internalization. Functional studies in primary human airway smooth muscle cells demonstrate that Gs-biased pepducins are not subject to conventional desensitization and thus may be good candidates for the development of next generation asthma therapeutics. Our study reports the first Gs-biased activator of the b2AR and provides valuable tools for the study of b2AR function. (c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

      "Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are ubiquitous antioxidant enzymes that reduce toxic peroxides. A new Vibrio vulnificus Prx, named Prx3, was identified and characterized in this study. Biochemical and mutational analyses revealed that Prx3 reduces H2O2, utilizing glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3) and glutathione (GSH) as reductants, and requires only N-terminal peroxidatic cysteine for its catalysis. These results, combined with the monomeric size of Prx3 observed under non-reducing conditions, suggested that Prx3 is a Grx3/GSH-dependent 1-Cys Prx and oxidized without forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. The prx3 mutation impaired growth in the medium containing peroxides and reduced virulence in mice, indicating that Prx3 is essential for survival under oxidative stress and pathogenesis of V. vulnificus. The Fe-S cluster regulator IscR activates prx3 by direct binding to a specific binding sequence centered at -44 from the transcription start site. The binding sequence was homologous to the Type 2 IscR-binding sequence, most likely recognized by the Fe-S clusterless apo-IscR in Escherichia coli. The iscR3CA mutant, chromosomally encoding the apo-locked IscR, exhibited 3-fold higher levels of activation of prx3 than the wild type and accumulated more IscR3CA protein in cells. The IscR-dependent activation of prx3 by aerobic growth and iron starvation was also associated with the increase in cellular levels of IscR protein. Taken together, the results suggested that IscR senses iron starvation as well as reactive oxygen species and shifts to the apo-form, which leads to the increase of cellular IscR and in turn prx3 expression, contributing to the survival and virulence of V. vulnificus during pathogenesis.

      "Usher syndrome (USH) is the leading genetic cause of combined hearing and vision loss. Among the three USH clinical types, type 2 (USH2) occurs most commonly. USH2A, GPR98, and WHRN are three known causative genes of USH2, whereas PDZD7 is a modifier gene found in USH2 patients. The proteins encoded by these four USH genes have been proposed to form a multiprotein complex, the USH2 complex, due to interactions found among some of these proteins in vitro, their colocalization in vivo, and mutual dependence of some of these proteins for their normal in vivo localizations. However, evidence showing the formation of the USH2 complex is missing, and details on how this complex is formed remain elusive. Here, we systematically investigated interactions among the intracellular regions of the four USH proteins using colocalization, yeast two-hybrid, and pull-down assays. We show that multiple domains of the four USH proteins interact among one another. Importantly, both WHRN and PDZD7 are required for the complex formation with USH2A and GPR98. In this USH2 quaternary complex, WHRN prefers to bind to USH2A, whereas PDZD7 prefers to bind to GPR98. Interaction between WHRN and PDZD7 is the bridge between USH2A and GPR98. Additionally, the USH2 quaternary complex has a variable stoichiometry. These findings suggest that a non-obligate, short term, and dynamic USH2 quaternary protein complex may exist in vivo. Our work provides valuable insight into the physiological role of the USH2 complex in vivo and informs possible reconstruction of the USH2 complex for future therapy.

      "Chemotactic migration of fibroblasts toward growth factors relies on their capacity to sense minute extracellular gradients and respond to spatially confined receptor-mediated signals. Currently, mechanisms underlying the gradient sensing of fibroblasts remain poorly understood. Using single-particle tracking methodology, we determined that a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) gradient induces a spatiotemporally restricted decrease in the mobility of LPA receptor 2 (LPA2) on chemotactic fibroblasts. The onset of decreased LPA2 mobility correlates to the spatial recruitment and coupling to LPA2-interacting proteins that anchor the complex to the cytoskeleton. These localized PDZ motif-mediated macromolecular complexes of LPA2 trigger a Ca(2+) puff gradient that governs gradient sensing and directional migration in response to LPA. Disruption of the PDZ motif-mediated assembly of the macromolecular complex of LPA2 disorganizes the gradient of Ca(2+) puffs, disrupts gradient sensing, and reduces the directional migration of fibroblasts toward LPA. Our findings illustrate that the asymmetric macromolecular complex formation of chemoattractant receptors mediates gradient sensing and provides a new mechanistic basis for models to describe gradient sensing of fibroblasts.

An age and ethnically diverse sample of 855 American adults were randomized to receive no health message, or either a gain-framed or loss-framed video presented on the Internet. Self-reported flossing was assessed longitudinally at 2 and 6 months. Among the entire sample, susceptibility interacted with frame to predict flossing. Participants who watched a video where the frame (gain/loss) matched perceived susceptibility (low/high) had significantly greater likelihood of flossing at recommended levels at the 6-month follow-up, compared with those who viewed a mismatched video or no video at all. However, young adults (18-24) showed stronger moderation by motivational orientation than by perceived susceptibility, in line with previous work largely conducted with young adult samples.

More widespread use of these combined capabilities have led to a vast expansion in our knowledge of the complexity of biological processes mediated by PTMs. The classes most actively pursued include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, O-GlcNAcylation, methylation, and acetylation. Very recently succinylation, SUMOylation, and citrullination have emerged.

      "Although the Cu(2+)-binding sites of the prion protein have been well studied when the protein is fully saturated by Cu(2+), the Cu(2+)-loading mechanism is just beginning to come into view. Because the Cu(2+)-binding modes at low and intermediate Cu(2+) occupancy necessarily represent the highest-affinity binding modes, these are very likely populated under physiological conditions, and it is thus essential to characterize them in order to understand better the biological function of copper-prion interactions. Besides binding-affinity data, almost no other thermodynamic parameters (e.g., DH and DS) have been measured, thus leaving undetermined the enthalpic and entropic factors that govern the free energy of Cu(2+) binding to the prion protein. In this study, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantify the thermodynamic parameters (K, DG, DH, and TDS) of Cu(2+) binding to a peptide, PrP(23-28, 57-98), that encompasses the majority of the residues implicated in Cu(2+) binding by full-length PrP. Use of the buffer N-(2-acetomido)-aminoethanesulfonic acid (ACES), which is also a well-characterized Cu(2+) chelator, allowed for the isolation of the two highest affinity binding events. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to characterize the different binding modes as a function of added Cu(2+). The Kd values determined by ITC, 7 and 380 nM, are well in line with those reported by others. The first binding event benefits significantly from a positive entropy, whereas the second binding event is enthalpically driven. The thermodynamic values associated with Cu(2+) binding by the Ab peptide, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, bear striking parallels to those found here for the prion protein. z8Wn@163.com\n",

Various modalities for distalizing the buccal segment have been reported. Conventional extraoral appliances can be used to obtain maximum anchorage. However, many patients reject headgear wear because of social and esthetic concerns, and the success of this treatment depends on patient compliance. Intraoral appliances, such as repelling magnets, nickel-titanium coils, pendulum appliance, Jones jig appliance, distal jet appliance, and modified Nance appliance, have been introduced to distalize the molars with little or no patient cooperation. However, intraoral appliances can result in anchorage loss of the anterior teeth and distal tipping of the maxillary molars. In this case report, we introduce a diversified rapid maxillary expansion appliance that was custom designed and fabricated for the treatment of a growing girl with a skeletal Class II malocclusion and severe crowding from a totally lingually positioned lateral incisor. The appliance concomitantly expanded the maxilla transversely and retracted the buccal segment sagittally, distalizing the maxillary molars to reach a Class I relationship and creating the spaces to displace the malpositioned lateral incisor. The uniqueness of this special diversified rapid maxillary expansion appliance was highlighted by a series of reconstructions and modifications at different stages of the treatment to reinforce the anchorage.

We project that after 6 to 18 months of disruptions, a large connected cluster of children unvaccinated for measles will accumulate across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This pool of susceptibility increases the expected size of a regional measles outbreak from 127,000 to 227,000 cases after 18 months, resulting in 2000 to 16,000 additional deaths (comparable to the numbers of Ebola deaths reported thus far).

      "To improve the delivery and integration of cell therapy using magnetic cell guidance for replacement of corneal endothelium, here we assess magnetic nanoparticles' (MNPs') effects on human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) in vitro. Biocompatible, 50 nm superparamagnetic nanoparticles endocytosed by cultured HCECs induced no short- or long-term change in viability or identity. Assessment of guidance of the magnetic HCECs in the presence of different magnet shapes and field strengths showed a 2.4-fold increase in delivered cell density compared to gravity alone. After cell delivery, HCECs formed a functional monolayer, with no difference in tight junction formation between MNP-loaded and control HCECs. These data suggest that nanoparticle-mediated magnetic cell delivery may increase the efficiency of cell delivery without compromising HCEC survival, identity or function. Future studies may assess the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic modality in vivo. From the clinical editor: The authors show in this article that magnetic force facilitates the delivery of human corneal endothelial cells loaded by superparamagnetic nanoparticles to cornea, without changing their morphology, identity or functional properties. This novel idea can potentially have vast impact in the treatment of corneal endothelial dystrophies by providing self-endothelial cells after ex-vivo expansion. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

      "Filopodia are 5-10 mm long processes that elongate by actin polymerization, and promote axon growth and guidance by exerting mechanical tension and by molecular signaling. Although axons elongate in response to mechanical tension, the structural and functional effects of tension specifically applied to growth cone filopodia are unknown. Here we developed a strategy to apply tension specifically to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) growth cone filopodia through surface-functionalized, membrane-targeted superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). When magnetic fields were applied to surface-bound SPIONs, RGC filopodia elongated directionally, contained polymerized actin filaments, and generated retrograde forces, behaving as bona fide filopodia. Data presented here support the premise that mechanical tension induces filopodia growth but counter the hypothesis that filopodial tension directly promotes growth cone advance. Future applications of these approaches may be used to induce sustained forces on multiple filopodia or other subcellular microstructures to study axon growth or cell migration. From the clinical editor: Mechanical tension to the tip of filopodia is known to promote axonal growth. In this article, the authors used superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) targeted specifically to membrane molecules, then applied external magnetic field to elicit filopodial elongation, which provided a tool to study the role of mechanical forces in filopodia dynamics and function.

      "To compare the analgesic efficacy of 2 types of anesthetic techniques-topical and topical associated with cryoanalgesia-during cataract surgery. Department of Ophthalmology, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. Prospective randomized study. Patients with symmetrical bilateral cataract had phacoemulsification with the use of an intraocular irrigation solution at room temperature in 1 eye and a cold (4degC) solution in the contralateral eye (Group 2). The pain related to the procedure was assessed using a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 representing no pain and 100 the worst pain. In addition, endothelial cell loss, the change in corneal thickness, and visual acuity were evaluated 30 days +- 2 (SD) after each surgery. The surgery duration, total irrigation volume, phacoemulsification time, and ultrasound power used were analyzed. The study enrolled 25 patients (50 eyes). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean pain score between Group 1 (26.0 +- 3.7) and Group 2 (21.3 +- 3.6) (P = .2016, paired t test). No significant difference was found in the mean corneal endothelial cell loss (Group 1: 10.0% +- 0.4%; Group 2: 9.9% +- 0.3%; P = .7576), corneal thickness increase (Group 1: 1.5 +- 1.0 mm; Group 2: 1.4 +- 0.9 mm; P = .9340), or visual acuity gain (Group 1: 0.54 +- 0.06 logMAR; Group 2: 0.55 +- 0.09 logMAR; P = .8208). There is no difference in the intensity of pain during phacoemulsification with the use of topical anesthesia or topical anesthesia associated with cryoanalgesia.

      "To evaluate the possible influence of anterior corneal surface asphericity on the refractive outcomes in eyes having intraocular lens (IOL) implantation after cataract surgery. Fondazione G.B. Bietti IRCCS, Rome, Italy. Retrospective comparative case series. Intraocular lens power was calculated using the Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, and SRK/T formulas. Asphericity (Q-value) was measured at 8.0 mm with a Placido-disk corneal topographer (Keratron), a rotating Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam), and a rotating Scheimpflug camera combined with Placido-disk corneal topography (Sirius). The relationship between the error in refraction prediction (ie, difference between expected refraction and refraction measured 1 month after surgery) and the Q-value was assessed by linear regression. The same IOL model (Acrysof SA60AT) was implanted in 115 eyes of 115 consecutive patients. Regression analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between the error in refraction prediction and the Q-value with all formulas and all devices. In all cases, a more negative Q-value (prolate cornea) was associated with a myopic outcome, whereas a more positive Q-value (oblate cornea) was associated with a hyperopic outcome. The highest coefficient of determination was detected between the Hoffer Q formula and the Placido-disk corneal topographer (R(2) = 0.2630), for which the error in refraction prediction (y) was related to the Q-value (x) according to the formula y = -0.2641 + 1.4589 x x. Corneal asphericity influences the refractive outcomes of IOL implantation and should be taken into consideration when using third-generation IOL power formulas.

      "Men exhibit higher rates of smoking relative to women (CDC, 2014). Given the associated health and socio-economic consequences, it would be valuable to explore the psychological factors underlying this variance. We contend that positive beliefs about smoking influence this difference, and that self-esteem moderates these beliefs. As part of a multi-institutional collaborative study funded by the American Legacy Foundation, 445 participants who reported being either steady or occasional smokers completed a series of questionnaires assessing their beliefs and behaviors involving smoking as well as several dispositional variables. Moderated mediation was used to test for conditional indirect effects. The total, indirect, and direct effects of gender were significant for individuals with lower, but not higher self-esteem. Males with lower self-esteem exhibited more positive beliefs and smoking behavior than females with lower self-esteem. No differences between males and females with higher self-esteem were observed. The gender gap in smoking behavior appears to occur primarily among individuals with lower self-esteem. It is a particularly detrimental risk factor for males, as it is related to higher positive views about smoking and increased tobacco consumption. These results highlight the importance of developing multifaceted gender specific belief-based preventative interventions to address smoking related behaviors. Copyright (c) 2015.

      "Findings from early cephalometric studies on airway changes after 2-jaw orthognathic surgery have been challenged because the previous anteroposterior interpretation of airway changes can now be evaluated in 3 dimensions. The aims of this study were to use cone-beam computed tomography to quantify the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and total airway volume changes associated with skeletal movements of the maxilla and mandible in a sample of patients undergoing 2-jaw orthognathic surgery for correction of skeletal malocclusion. Skeletal movements and airway volumes of 71 postpubertal patients (31 male, 40 female; mean age, 18.8 years) were measured. They were divided into 2 groups based on ANB angle, overjet, and occlusion (Class II: ANB, >2deg; overjet, >1 mm; total, 35 subjects; and Class III: ANB, <1deg; overjet, <1 mm; total, 36 subjects). Presurgical and postsurgical measurements were collected for horizontal, vertical, and transverse movements of the maxilla and the mandible, along with changes in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and total airways. Associations between the directional movements of skeletal structures and the regional changes in airway volume were quantified. Changes in the most constricted area were also noted. Horizontal movements of D-point were significantly associated with increases in both total airway (403.6 +- 138.6 mm(3); P <0.01) and oropharynx (383.9 +- 127.9 mm(3); P <0.01) volumes. Vertical movements of the posterior nasal spine were significantly associated with decreases in total airway volume (-459.2 +- 219.9 mm(3); P = 0.04) and oropharynx volume (-639.7 +- 195.3 mm(3); P <0.01), increases in nasopharynx (187.2 +- 47.1 mm(3); P <0.01) volume, and decreases in the most constricted area (-10.63 +- 3.69 mm(2); P <0.01). In the Class III patients only, the vertical movement of D-point was significantly associated with decreases in both total airway (-724.0 +- 284.4 mm(3); P = 0.02) and oropharynx (-648.2 +- 270.4 mm(3); P = 0.02) volumes. A similar negative association was observed for the most constricted area for the vertical movement of D-point (-15.45 +- 4.91 mm(2); P <0.01). Optimal control of airway volume is through management of the mandible in the horizontal direction and the vertical movement of the posterior maxilla for all patients. The surgeon and the orthodontist should optimally plan these movements to control gains or losses in airway volume as a result of orthognathic surgery.

      "Studies in animals and postmortem human brain tissue support a role for P-glycoprotein in clearance of cerebral b-amyloid across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We tested the hypothesis that BBB P-glycoprotein activity is diminished in Alzheimer disease (AD) by accounting for an AD-related reduction in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). We compared P-glycoprotein activity in mild-AD patients (n = 9) and cognitively normal, age-matched controls (n = 9) using PET with a labeled P-glycoprotein substrate, (11)C-verapamil, and (15)O-water to measure rCBF. BBB P-glycoprotein activity was expressed as the (11)C-verapamil radioactivity extraction ratio ((11)C-verapamil brain distributional clearance, K1/rCBF). Compared with controls, BBB P-glycoprotein activity was significantly lower in the parietotemporal, frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices and hippocampus of mild AD subjects. BBB P-glycoprotein activity in brain regions affected by AD is reduced and is independent of rCBF. This study improves on prior work by eliminating the confounding effect that reduced rCBF has on assessment of BBB P-glycoprotein activity and suggests that impaired P-glycoprotein activity may contribute to cerebral b-amyloid accumulation in AD. P-glycoprotein induction or activation to increase cerebral b-amyloid clearance could constitute a novel preventive or therapeutic strategy for AD.

      "Directional cell migration in an electric field, a phenomenon called galvanotaxis or electrotaxis, occurs in many types of cells, and may play an important role in wound healing and development. Small extracellular electric fields can guide the migration of amoeboid cells, and we established a large-scale screening approach to search for mutants with electrotaxis phenotypes from a collection of 563 Dictyostelium discoideum strains with morphological defects. We identified 28 strains that were defective in electrotaxis and 10 strains with a slightly higher directional response. Using plasmid rescue followed by gene disruption, we identified some of the mutated genes, including some previously implicated in chemotaxis. Among these, we studied PiaA, which encodes a critical component of TORC2, a kinase protein complex that transduces changes in motility by activating the kinase PKB (also known as Akt). Furthermore, we found that electrotaxis was decreased in mutants lacking gefA, rasC, rip3, lst8, or pkbR1, genes that encode other components of the TORC2-PKB pathway. Thus, we have developed a high-throughput screening technique that will be a useful tool to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of electrotaxis.

      "Allosteric modulators of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have a number of potential advantages compared to agonists or antagonists that bind to the orthosteric site of the receptor. These include the potential for receptor selectivity, maintenance of the temporal and spatial fidelity of signaling in vivo, the ceiling effect of the allosteric cooperativity which may prevent overdose issues, and engendering bias by differentially modulating distinct signaling pathways. Here we describe the discovery, synthesis, and molecular pharmacology of d-opioid receptor-selective positive allosteric modulators (d PAMs). These d PAMs increase the affinity and/or efficacy of the orthosteric agonists leu-enkephalin, SNC80 and TAN67, as measured by receptor binding, G protein activation, b-arrestin recruitment, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation. As such, these compounds are useful pharmacological tools to probe the molecular pharmacology of the d receptor and to explore the therapeutic potential of d PAMs in diseases such as chronic pain and depression. 12936300496\n",

      "To evaluate and compare the accuracy of different methods to measure and predict postoperative astigmatism with toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Ein-Tal Ophthalmology Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel. Retrospective case series. Postoperative corneal astigmatism was measured with 3 devices (IOLMaster 500; optical low-coherence reflectometry [OLCR]-based Lenstar LS 900; Atlas topographer) and compared with the manifest astigmatic refractive outcome in patients with toric IOLs. The error in the predicted residual astigmatism was calculated by vector analysis according to the measurement and calculation method used to predict the required toric IOL cylinder power. The centroid errors in predicted residual astigmatism were against the rule with the Alcon and Holladay toric calculators (0.53 to 0.56 diopter [D]), were lower with the Baylor nomogram (0.21 to 0.26 D), and were lowest for the Barrett toric calculator (0.01 to 0.16 D) (P <.001). The Barrett toric calculator had the lowest median absolute error in predicted residual astigmatism (0.35 to 0.54 D, all devices) compared with the Alcon and Holladay toric calculators with or without the Baylor nomogram (P <.021). The Barrett toric calculator and the OLCR device achieved the most accurate results; 75.0% and 97.1% of eyes were within +-0.50 D and +-0.75 D of the predicted residual astigmatism, respectively. Prediction of astigmatic outcomes with toric IOLs can be improved with appropriate measuring devices and methods to establish the required toric IOL power. Copyright (c) 2015 ASCRS and ESCRS.

The aim of the present trial was to determine the efficacy of a mechanical device (PressureEasy(r)) in the continuous control of P cuff in patients intubated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-cuffed tracheal tubes, compared with routine care using a manometer. This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, cross-over study. All patients requiring intubation with a predicted duration of mechanical ventilation >=48 h were eligible. Eighteen patients randomly received continuous control of P cuff with PressureEasy(r) device for 24 h, followed by discontinuous control (every 4 h) with a manual manometer for 24 h, or vice versa. P cuff and airway pressure were continuously recorded. P cuff target was 25 cmH2O during the two periods. The percentage of time spent with P cuff 20-30 cmH2O (median (IQR) 34 % (17-57) versus 50 % (35-64), p = 0.184) and the percentage of time spent with P cuff <20 cmH2O (23 % (5-63) versus 43 % (16-60), p = 0.5) were similar during continuous control of P cuff and routine care, respectively. However, the percentage of time spent with P cuff >30 cmH2O was significantly higher during continuous control compared with routine care of tracheal cuff (26 % (14-39) versus 7 % (1-18), p = 0.002). No significant difference was found in P cuff (25 (18-28) versus 21 (18-26), p = 0.17), mean airway pressure (14 (10-17) versus 14 (11-16), p = 0.679), or coefficient of variation of P cuff (19 % (11-26) versus 20 % (11-25), p = 0.679) during continuous control compared with routine care of tracheal cuff, respectively. PressureEasy(r) did not demonstrate a better control of P cuff between 20 and 30 cmH2O, compared with routine care using a manometer. Moreover, the device use resulted in significantly higher time spent with overinflation of tracheal cuff, which might increase the risk for tracheal ischemic lesions.

      "Forward genetic screens in Drosophila melanogaster for modifiers of position-effect variegation have revealed the basis of much of our understanding of heterochromatin. We took an analogous approach to identify genes required for epigenetic repression in human cells. A nonlethal forward genetic screen in near-haploid KBM7 cells identified the HUSH (human silencing hub) complex, comprising three poorly characterized proteins, TASOR, MPP8, and periphilin; this complex is absent from Drosophila but is conserved from fish to humans. Loss of HUSH components resulted in decreased H3K9me3 both at endogenous genomic loci and at retroviruses integrated into heterochromatin. Our results suggest that the HUSH complex is recruited to genomic loci rich in H3K9me3, where subsequent recruitment of the methyltransferase SETDB1 is required for further H3K9me3 deposition to maintain transcriptional silencing.

      "Circadian and metabolic physiology are intricately intertwined, as illustrated by Rev-erba, a transcription factor (TF) that functions both as a core repressive component of the cell-autonomous clock and as a regulator of metabolic genes. Here, we show that Rev-erba modulates the clock and metabolism by different genomic mechanisms. Clock control requires Rev-erba to bind directly to the genome at its cognate sites, where it competes with activating ROR TFs. By contrast, Rev-erba regulates metabolic genes primarily by recruiting the HDAC3 co-repressor to sites to which it is tethered by cell type-specific transcription factors. Thus, direct competition between Rev-erba and ROR TFs provides a universal mechanism for self-sustained control of the molecular clock across all tissues, whereas Rev-erba uses lineage-determining factors to convey a tissue-specific epigenomic rhythm that regulates metabolism tailored to the specific need of that tissue.

      "NMDARs and ASIC1a both exist in central synapses and mediate important physiological and pathological conditions, but the functional relationship between them is unclear. Here we report several novel findings that may shed light on the functional relationship between these two ion channels in the excitatory postsynaptic membrane of mouse hippocampus. Firstly, NMDAR activation induced by either NMDA or OGD led to increased [Ca(2+)](i)and greater apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in cultured hippocampal neurons; these cell deaths were prevented by application of NMDAR antagonists. Secondly, ASIC1a activation induced by pH 6.0 extracellular solution (ECS) showed similar increases in apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths; these cell deaths were prevented by ASIC1a antagonists, and also by NMDAR antagonists. Since increased [Ca(2+)](i)leads to increased cell deaths and since NMDAR exhibits much greater calcium permeability than ASIC1a, these data suggest that ASIC1a-induced neuronal death is mediated through activation of NMDARs. Thirdly, treatment of hippocampal cultures with both NMDA and acidic ECS induced greater degrees of cell deaths than either NMDA or acidic ECS treatment alone. These results suggest that ASIC1a activation up-regulates NMDAR function. Additional data supporting the functional relationship between ASIC1a and NMDAR are found in our electrophysiology experiments in hippocampal slices, where stimulation of ASIC1a induced a marked increase in NMDAR EPSC amplitude, and inhibition of ASIC1a resulted in a decrease in NMDAR EPSC amplitude. In summary, we present evidence that ASIC1a activity facilitates NMDAR function and exacerbates NMDAR-mediated neuronal death in pathological conditions. These findings are invaluable to the search for novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of brain ischemia. S69MF@qq.com\n",

      "There is a noted advantage of dense neighborhoods in language acquisition, but the learning mechanism that drives the effect is not well understood. Two hypotheses--long-term auditory word priming and phonological working memory--have been advanced in the literature as viable accounts. These were evaluated in two treatment studies enrolling twelve children with phonological delay. Study 1 exposed children to dense neighbors versus non-neighbors before training sound production in evaluation of the priming hypothesis. Study 2 exposed children to the same stimuli after training sound production as a test of the phonological working memory hypothesis. Results showed that neighbors led to greater phonological generalization than non-neighbors, but only when presented prior to training production. There was little generalization and no differential effect of exposure to neighbors or non-neighbors after training production. Priming was thus supported as a possible mechanism of learning behind the dense neighborhood advantage in phonological acquisition. 7b788DMF@qq.com\n",

We aimed to fulfil this need by testing effectiveness of these drugs in a standard clinical care setting. For this multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited adults (aged 18-65 years) undergoing expectant management for a single ureteric stone identified by CT at 24 UK hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned by a remote randomisation system to tamsulosin 400 mg, nifedipine 30 mg, or placebo taken daily for up to 4 weeks, using an algorithm with centre, stone size (<=5 mm or >5 mm), and stone location (upper, mid, or lower ureter) as minimisation covariates. Participants, clinicians, and trial personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who did not need further intervention for stone clearance within 4 weeks of randomisation, analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population defined as all eligible patients for whom we had primary outcome data. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT number 2010-019469-26, and as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number 69423238. Between Jan 11, 2011, and Dec 20, 2013, we randomly assigned 1167 participants, 1136 (97%) of whom were included in the primary analysis (17 were excluded because of ineligibility and 14 participants were lost to follow-up). 303 (80%) of 379 participants in the placebo group did not need further intervention by 4 weeks, compared with 307 (81%) of 378 in the tamsulosin group (adjusted risk difference 1*3% [95% CI -5*7 to 8*3]; p=0*73) and 304 (80%) of 379 in the nifedipine group (0*5% [-5*6 to 6*5]; p=0*88). No difference was noted between active treatment and placebo (p=0*78), or between tamsulosin and nifedipine (p=0*77). Serious adverse events were reported in three participants in the nifedipine group (one had right loin pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting; one had malaise, headache, and chest pain; and one had severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, and left arm pain) and in one participant in the placebo group (headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, and chronic abdominal pain).

      "Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been transformed by targeted therapies directed against molecular aberrations specifically activated within an individual patient's tumor. However, such therapies are currently only available against a small number of such aberrations, and new targets and therapeutics are needed. Our laboratory has previously identified the MERTK receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) as a potential drug target in multiple cancer types, including NSCLC. We have recently developed UNC2025--the first-in-class small molecule inhibitor targeting MERTK with pharmacokinetic properties sufficient for clinical translation. Here, we utilize this compound to further validate the important emerging biologic functions of MERTK in lung cancer pathogenesis, to establish that MERTK can be effectively targeted by a clinically translatable agent, and to demonstrate that inhibition of MERTK is a valid treatment strategy in a wide variety of NSCLC lines independent of their driver oncogene status, including in lines with an EGFR mutation, a KRAS/NRAS mutation, an RTK fusion, or another or unknown driver oncogene. Biochemically, we report the selectivity of UNC2025 for MERTK, and its inhibition of oncogenic downstream signaling. Functionally, we demonstrate that UNC2025 induces apoptosis of MERTK-dependent NSCLC cell lines, while decreasing colony formation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo in murine models. These findings provide further evidence for the importance of MERTK in NSCLC, and demonstrate that MERTK inhibition by UNC2025 is a feasible, clinically relevant treatment strategy in a wide variety of NSCLC subtypes, which warrants further investigation in clinical trials.

      "In recent years in silico protein structure prediction reached a level where fully automated servers can generate large pools of near-native structures. However, the identification and further refinement of the best structures from the pool of models remain problematic. To address these issues, we have developed (i) a target-specific selective refinement (SR) protocol; and (ii) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based ranking (SMDR) method. In SR the all-atom refinement of structures is accomplished via the Rosetta Relax protocol, subject to specific constraints determined by the size and complexity of the target. The best-refined models are selected with SMDR by testing their relative stability against gradual heating through all-atom MD simulations. Through extensive testing we have found that Mufold-MD, our fully automated protein structure prediction server updated with the SR and SMDR modules consistently outperformed its previous versions.

      "Herein, we describe the first total syntheses of five members of the dimeric nuphar alkaloids: (+)-6,6'-dihydroxythiobinupharidine (+)-1 a, (+)-6-hydroxythiobinupharidine (+)-1 b, (-)-6,6'-dihydroxythionuphlutine (-)-2 a, (-)-6,6'-dihydroxyneothiobinupharidine (-)-3 a, and (+)-6,6'-dihydroxyneothionuphlutine (+)-4 a. The latter two have not been found in nature. We have also made each of their enantiomers (-)-1 a-b, (+)-2 a, (+)-3 a, and (-)-4 a. The key step in these syntheses was the dimerization of an a-aminonitrile (a hydrolytically stable surrogate for its corresponding hemiaminal) with chiral Lewis acid complexes. We have also reassigned the literature structures of (+)-1 a-1 b--for those instances in which the NMR spectra were obtained in CD3OD--to their corresponding CD3O-adducts. Our efforts provide for the first time apoptosis data for (-)-3 a, (+)-4 a, and all five non-natural enantiomers prepared.

      "In the last two decades, the debate on the meaning of science in relation to societies that create it, nourish it, and benefit from it, focused on civil society's ability to produce knowledge. This yielded first the concept of participatory science and later the wider concept of participatory research. Throughout Europe, numerous collective experimentations have generated countless interactions, and new interfaces between the world of research and civil society are constantly being created. But in spite of the proliferation of these experiences, a paradox slows down their acknowledgment and legitimation. On the one hand, these interactions often go unseen and unrecognized by the institutions, public policies, and even at times their very creators. On the other hand, scientists, are still overwhelmingly wary of civil society and, perceiving only its intellectual deficit and lack of comprehension, they fail to consider the study and development of these interactions as being of primary importance. The Sciences and Society Alliance, which was recently founded in France, provides a platform where these collaborative experiences can be collected, studied, supported, communicated, and institutionally acknowledged. The launch of this process,which is soon to be European in scope, answers the need to bring science into the democratic path tread by the societies that create it. In its ability to compose diversity, this process is an example of deep democracy. lq0o@qq.com\n",

      "With the hope of discovering effective analgesics with fewer side effects, attention has recently shifted to allosteric modulators of the opioid receptors. In the past two years, the first chemotypes of positive or silent allosteric modulators (PAMs or SAMs, respectively) of m- and d-opioid receptor types have been reported in the literature. During a structure-guided lead optimization campaign with m-PAMs BMS-986121 and BMS-986122 as starting compounds, we discovered a new chemotype that was confirmed to display m-PAM or m-SAM activity depending on the specific substitutions as assessed by endomorphin-1-stimulated b-arrestin2 recruitment assays in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-m PathHunter cells. The most active m-PAM of this series was analyzed further in competition binding and G-protein activation assays to understand its effects on ligand binding and to investigate the nature of its probe dependence. 0z8o@163.com\n",

      "The control and eventual elimination of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) requires the expansion of current control and surveillance activities. A systematic review of the published literature on the costs of HAT prevention, treatment, and control, in addition to the economic burden, was conducted. All studies that contained primary or secondary data on costs of prevention, treatment and control were considered, resulting in the inclusion of 42 papers. The geographically focal nature of the disease and a lack of standardization in the cost data limit the usefulness of the available information for making generalizations across diverse settings. More recent information on the costs of treatment and control interventions for HAT is needed to provide accurate information for analyses and planning. The cost information contained herein can be used to inform rational decision making in control and elimination programs, and to assess potential synergies with existing vector-borne disease control programs, but programs would benefit significantly from new cost data collection.

      "In Tunisia, Leishmania parasites are responsible of visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania infantum species while three cutaneous disease forms are documented: chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania killicki, sporadic cutaneous form (SCL) caused by L. infantum and the predominant zoonotic cutaneous leishmanaisis (ZCL) due to Leishmania major. ZCL reservoirs are rodents of the Psammomys and Meriones genera, while for SCL the dog is supposed to be a reservoir. Ctenodactylus gundii is involved in the transmission of L. killicki. However, other mammals could constitute potential reservoir hosts in Tunisia and other North African countries. In order to explore the role of hedgehogs as potential reservoirs of leishmaniasis, specimens (N=6) were captured during July-November period in 2011-2013 in an SCL endemic area in El Kef region, North-Western Tunisia. Using morphological characteristics, all specimens were described and measured. Biopsies from liver, heart, kidney and spleen of each animal were used to extract genomic DNA, which was further used in PCR assays to assess the presence of Leishmania parasites. Different PCRs targeting kinetoplast minicircles, ITS1, mini-exon genes and a repetitive Leishmania- specific sequence, were applied. To further identify Leishmania species involved, RFLP analysis of amplified fragments was performed with appropriate restriction enzymes. Using morphological characters, animals were identified as North African hedgehogs, also called Algerian hedgehogs, that belong to the Erinaceidae family, genus Atelerix Pomel 1848, and species algirus (Lereboullet, 1842). PCR results showed in total that all specimens were Leishmania infected, with different organs incriminated, mainly liver and spleen. Results were confirmed by direct sequencing of amplified fragments. Species identification showed that all specimens were infected with L. major, three of which were additionally co-infected with L. infantum. The present study demonstrates, for the first time in Tunisia, natural infection of hedgehog animals (Atelerix algirus) by the Leishmania parasites species L. major and L. infantum. L. major is also detected for the first time in wild animals captured in the North Western part of the country; likewise for the co-infection of these animals by the 2 Leishmania species. This mammal could play a potential reservoir role in epidemiology of SCL or ZCL and could contribute to emergence or extension of ZCL in the studied region. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "National malaria treatment policies are devised to guide health professionals and to facilitate diagnosis and case management. Following the recommendations of the WHO, Cameroon changed its malaria treatment policy from monotherapy to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. We report an investigation into trends of case management following this change in policy. Data was collected retrospectively, through consultation and perusal of laboratory and prescription registers of the Mbakong Health Centre. Analysis of data was done using SPSS and SAS Statistics. Data presented herein demonstrate that from 2006 to 2012, a total of 2484 (58.7%) of the total prescriptions included an anti-malarial, 1989 (47.0%) included an antibiotic and 1935(45.7%) included an antipyretic. The anti-malarials prescribed were Anti-malaria combination therapy (ACT) - 1216 (47.6%), quinine 1044 (40.8%) or SP 296 (11.6%). Of the 1216 patients prescribed an ACT, 441(36.3%) had a positive malaria parasite confirmation, 746 (61.3%) were negative for plasmodium. Overall, 29 patients (2.4%) were treated either with an ACT without any test performed. Quinine intake was recorded in 566 (54.2%) patients positive for plasmodium. ACT prescription increased from 23% in 2007 to between 44 and 45% in 2008-2009. During this period there was a corresponding drop in the prescription of quinine from 38% in 2007 to 13% in 2009 (r=-0.43, p>0.05). Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) was restrictively prescribed to women of childbearing age (97.0%) after 2008. Antibiotics prescription dropped from 53.7% to 39.3% from 2010 to 2012. The odds of being prescribed an antibiotic was significantly higher in patients with a malaria negative result compared to malaria positive patients (OR=6.12, CI 4.74-7.91, p<0.00001). Overall, there is an over treatment of malaria, thus departing from the WHO guidelines of appropriate treatment. Although there is an overall increase in the prescription of ACT, less prescription of quinine and a noticeable restrain from prescription of SP to febrile cases, the old practice was still rampant. There is need for healthcare workers to adhere to guidelines in order to enhance the rational use of drugs to achieve appropriate treatment of uncomplicated malaria according to WHO guidelines.

      "We evaluated Mastomys natelensis rat as an animal model for Rhodesian sleeping sickness. Parasitaemia, clinical and pathological characteristics induced by T. b. rhodesiense isolates, KETRI 3439, 3622 and 3637 were compared in Mastomys rats and Swiss white mice. Each isolate was intra-peritonially injected in mice and rat groups (n=12) at 1x10(4) trypanosomes/0.2mL. Pre-patent period (PP) range for KETRI 3439 and KETRI 3622-groups was 3-6 days for mice and 4-5 days for rats while for KETRI 3637-infected mice and rats was 5-9 and 4-12 days, respectively. Pairwise comparison between PP of mice and rats separately infected with either isolate showed no significant difference (p>0.05). The PP's of KETRI 3637-infected mice were significantly (p>0.01) longer than those infected with KETRI 3439 or KETRI 3622, a trend also observed in rats. The second parasitaemic wave was more prominent in mice. Clinical signs included body weakness, dyspnoea, peri-orbital oedema and extreme emaciation which were more common in rats. Survival time for KETRI 3439 and 3622-infected groups was significantly (p<0.05) longer in mice than rats but similar in KETRI 3637-infected groups. Inflammatory lesions were more severe in rats than mice. All mice and KETRI 3622-infected rats had splenomegaly, organ congestion with rats additionally showing prominent lymphadenopathy. KETRI 3439-infected rats showed hemorrhagic pneumonia, enteritis with moderate splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. KETRI 3637-infected rats had the most severe lesions characterized by prominent splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, enlarged adrenal glands, organ congestion, generalized oedemas, gastroenteritis, pneumonia and brain congestion. KETRI 3637-infected Mastomys is a suitable model for studying pathophysiology of HAT. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. +86-7954649954\n",

      "Protozoal parasites are the causative agents of many insect-borne infectious diseases worldwide with impact on human and animal health. Leishmaniasis is caused by Leishmania spp. and transmitted by female Phlebotomine sand flies. In Portugal, two species of Phlebotomus (Larroussius), namely Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus ariasi are the proven vectors of Leishmania infantum. Phlebotomine females and males rest and breed in the same sites; and these locations can be predicted according to the male external genitalia maturation. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the timing of complete rotation of the male external genitalia in laboratory conditions and to characterize the external genitalia rotation in field captured males to predict the male and female sand fly breeding and resting sites. This knowledge can be applied in the design and implementation of integrated sand fly control strategies targeting these sites. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 16748317270\n",

      "We aimed at characterizing commercial and traditional village poultry farming in Mali, with a focus on practices influencing the risk of transmission of avian influenza and Newcastle disease. Surveys were conducted in 2009-2011 in a study area covering approximately 98% of the Malian poultry population. Among the 282 commercial farms investigated, of which 64 had not been known by the government authorities, 83% were located within a 50km radius from the capitals of the country and regions and 54% had low biosecurity standard. Among the 152 randomly selected village household flocks investigated, characteristics were overall similar to those in other African countries but some differences were notable including a large flock size (median 44 poultry), a low presence of ducks and geese (11% and 1.1% of flocks, respectively), vaccination against Newcastle disease being common (49% of flocks), a low proportion of households selling sick and dead birds (0.7% and 0%, respectively) and limited cohabitation between poultry and humans at night. Our recommendations to limit the risk of disease transmission include (1) for commercial farms, to introduce compulsory farm registration and accreditation, to increase technical proficiency and access to credit for farms with low biosecurity, and to support poultry producer associations; (2) for village poultry, to promote better quarantine and management of sick and dead birds. Such detailed knowledge of country-specific characteristics of poultry production systems is essential to be able to develop more efficient disease risk management policies.

      "In Fasciola gigantica cathepsin L1 (CatL1) is a family of predominant proteases that is expressed in caecal epithelial cells and secreted into the excretory-secretory products (ES). CatL1 isotypes are expressed in both early and late stages of the life cycle and the parasites use them for migration and digestion. Therefore, CatL1 is a plausible target for vaccination against this parasite. Recombinant pro-F.gigantica CatL1 (rproFgCatL1) and recombinant mature F.gigantica CatL1 (rmatFgCatL1) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The vaccination was performed in Imprinting Control Region (ICR) mice (n=10) by subcutaneous injection with 50mg of rproFgCatL1 and rmatFgCatL1 combined with Freund's adjuvant. Two weeks after the second boost, mice were infected with 15 metacercariae by the oral route. The level of protection of rproFgCatL1 and rmatFgCatL1 vaccines was estimated to be 39.1, 41.7% and 44.9, 47.2% when compared with non vaccinated-infected and adjuvant-infected controls, respectively. Antibodies in the immune sera of vaccinated mice were shown by immuno-blotting to react with the native FgCatL1 in the extract of newly excysted juveniles (NEJ), 4-week-old juveniles and the ES products of 4 week-old juveniles. By determining the levels of IgG1 and IgG2a in the immune sera, which are indicative of Th2 and Th1 immune response, respectively, it was found that both Th1 and Th2 responses were significantly increased in rproFgCatL1- and rmatFgCatL1-immunized groups compared with the control groups, with higher levels of Th2 (IgG1) than Th1 (IgG2a). The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in rmatFgCatL1-immunized group showed a significant decrease when compared to rproFgCatL1-immunized group, indicating that rmatFgCatL1-vaccinated mice had reduced liver parenchyma damage. The pathological lesions of liver in vaccinated groups were significantly decreased when compared with control groups. This study indicates that rFgCatL1 has a potential as a vaccine candidate against F. gigantica in mice, and this potential will be tested in ruminants. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB) is a highly effective method which targets mosquitoes based on their sugar foraging behavior, by presenting baits of attractive compounds in combination with sugar and oral toxin to local mosquito populations. Environmental concerns and insecticide selection-pressure have prompted investigations of novel, ecologically-harmless substances which can be used as insecticides. This study examined the efficacy of microencapsulated garlic-oil as the oral toxin component of ATSB for controlling Anopheles sergentii populations inhabiting desert-surrounded wetlands in Israel. ATSB solution containing 0.4% encapsulated garlic oil was applied to local vegetation around a streamlet located in the lower Jordan Valley. To determine the propensity of bait ingestion, and assess the potential ecological impact of the method, mosquito and non-target specimens were collected and tested for the presence of natural plant- or attractive sugar bait (ASB)-derived sugars. Over the experimental period, biting-pressure values in the ATSB treatment site decreased by 97.5%, while at the control site, treated with non-toxic ASB, no significant changes were observed. Approximately 70% of the mosquitoes collected before both treatments, as well as those captured following the application of ASB at the control site, were found to have ingested sugar prior to capture. Non-target insects were minimally affected by the treatment when ATSB was applied to foliage of non-flowering plants. Of the non-Diptera species, only 0.7% of the sampled non-target insects were found to have ingested ASB-solution which was applied to green vegetation, compared with 8.5% which have foraged on ASB-derived sugars applied to flowering plants. Conversely, a high proportion of the non-target species belonging to the order Diptera, especially non-biting midges, were found to have ingested foliage-applied ASB, with more than 36% of the specimens collected determined to have foraged on bait-derived sugars. These results prove that food-grade, EPA-exempt microencapsulated garlic oil is a highly effective insecticide which can be utilized for mosquito population control. The relatively short half-life of this active ingredient makes it a suitable for use in areas where repeated application is possible, limiting the accumulation of deleterious compounds and ensuring minimal environmental impact when applied in accordance with label recommendations.

      "Adverse side effects and drug resistance issues are the two most important drawbacks which influence the widespread use of existing antileishmanial drugs. Use of immune stimulating agent with standard antileishmanial might be helpful to minimize the toxic effect of drug, shorten the dose regimen and delay the emergence of resistance. In the present study, we explored the in vitro immunomodulatory potential of an immunomodulator, leptin with lower concentration of standard drug, miltefosine. The level of Th1/Th2 cytokines, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species and phagocytic activity was assessed by ELISA, Griess reaction and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Leptin at a concentration of 15mg/mL showed heightened level of Th1 cytokines and nitric oxide generation from murine macrophages (J-774A.1 cells). Leptin (15mg/mL) also reduces the effective concentration of miltefosine by 2-folds from 7.5mM to 3.7mM. When given in conjunction with lower concentration of miltefosine (4mM), leptin (15mg/mL) significantly (***p<0.001) elevated the level of IL-12 (7.7 fold), TNF-a (8.1 fold) and nitric oxide (6.6 fold) along with markedly (***p<0.001) suppressed level of IL-10 and TGF-b when compared with untreated infected macrophages. Leptin plus miltefosine also induces the phagocytic ability (**p<0.01) of macrophages in comparison to leptin alone and miltefosine alone treated groups. These finding illustrate that leptin activates host macrophages to generate protective immune response for the successful elimination of Leishmania parasite at lower concentration of miltefosine and has potential for further exploration in experimental animal model of visceral leishmaniasis (VL).

      "Horse flies and deer flies are common names applied to members of the family Tabanidae (Diptera). Tabanid flies are pestiferous and of veterinary and medical importance, with about 244 species in India. They are major vectors of Trypanosoma evansi that causes trypanosomiasis (surra disease). Lack of stable morphological characters, and scarcity of taxonomic expertise, is major impediments for accurate species identification of these important pest and disease vectors. Molecular data, especially DNA barcode data, has been widely used in the identification of Diptera of economic importance. We evaluated the utility of DNA barcode data to discriminate the vectors of surra disease (trypanosomiasis) from India. We used barcode gap and reciprocal monophyly (neighbor-joining and Bayesian tree) criteria to analyze barcode data. A total of 46 specimens belonging to 7 species under four genera in two subfamilies were used for this study. DNA barcode data was not available previously for these species. Analysis revealed that all morphologically identifiable species can be discriminated using DNA barcoding data. Further, our study clearly demonstrated the presence of cryptic species in Chrysops dispar. Moreover, we revealed that closely related species without stable taxonomic distinguishing characters in the \"\"Tabanus striatus species complex\"\" can be discriminated using DNA barcode data.

      "Circulating anodic antigen (CAA) testing is a powerful, increasingly-used tool for diagnosis of active schistosome infection. We sought to determine the feasibility and reliability of measuring CAA in blood spots collected on Whatman 903 protein saver cards, which are the predominant filter papers used worldwide for dried blood spot (DBS) research and clinical care. CAA was eluted from blood spots collected from 19 individuals onto Whatman 903 cards in Mwanza, Tanzania, and the assay was optimized to achieve CAA ratios comparable to those obtained from the spots' corresponding serum samples. The optimized assay was then used to determine the correlation of serum samples (n=16) with DBS from cards that had been stored for 8 years at ambient temperature. Using a DBS volume equivalent to approximately four times the quantity of serum, CAA testing in DBS had a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 79% compared to CAA testing in serum. CAA testing was reliable in samples eluted from Whatman 903 cards that had been stored for 8 years at ambient temperature. The overall kappa coefficient was 0.53 (standard error 0.17, p<0.001). We conclude that CAA can be reliably and accurately measured in DBS collected onto the filter paper that is most commonly used for clinical care and research, and that can be stored from prolonged periods of time. This finding opens new avenues for future work among more than 700million individuals living in areas worldwide in which schistosomes are endemic. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A newly developed method for the quantification of helminth eggs on hands was tested among schoolchildren in a rural South African region to look at the role hands play in helminth infection, and to determine the risk factors for hand contamination. The study found 16.6% of participants' hands positive for helminth eggs, with E. vermicularis most commonly identified. Egg concentrations on hands ranged from 0 to 57 eggs/2 hands. Gender, toilet type used at home, and not reporting to wash hands with soap before eating were all associated with the presence of eggs on hands. The study highlights the need to improve sanitation facilities, and promote handwashing with soap in schools to prevent transmission of E. vermicularis. Crown Copyright (c) 2015.

The IIL is its first invasive stage, surface proteins are directly exposed to host environment and are crucial for larval invasion and development. In this study, shotgun LC-MS/MS was used to analyze surface protein profiles of ML and IIL. Totally, 41 proteins common to both larvae, and 85 ML biased and 113 IIL biased proteins. Some proteins (e.g., putative scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain protein and putative onchocystatin) were involved in host-parasite interactions. Gene ontology analysis revealed that proteins involved in generation of precursor metabolites and energy; and nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process were enriched in IIL at level 4. Some IIL biased proteins might play important role in larval invasion and development. qPCR results confirmed the high expression of some genes in IIL. Our study provides new insights into larval invasion, host-Trichinella interaction and for screening vaccine candidate antigens. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although several taxonomical studies have shown that the infection by this species occurs primarily in the esophagus of primates, evidence for the occurrence of these parasites in other hosts (marsupials, rodents and bats) has become the subject of investigation by several groups. In this work, we describe the presence of Spirura guianensis Ortlepp, 1924 in the marsupial Gracilinanus agilis (Marsupialia: Didelphidae) found in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul state of Brazil. Structural characteristics of this nematode were identified using light microscopy (bright field and fluorescence stereomicroscopy) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) approaches. Details of the surface topography such as cephalic projections, ventral boss, details of the caudal papillae and cuticular ornamentations were shown, providing taxonomic characteristics that may help in the establishment of diagnostic protocols. In addition, the presence of this species in a new host and new geographical area of Brazil provide grounds for a revision on the distribution of S. guianensis in South America.

      "Subunit-based vaccines are safer than live or attenuated pathogen vaccines, although they are generally weak immunogens. Thus, proper combination of immunization strategies and adjuvants are needed to increase their efficacy. We have previously protected C3H/HeN mice from Toxoplasma gondii infection by immunization with the serine protease inhibitor-1 (TgPI-1) in combination with alum. In this work, we explore an original vaccination protocol that combines administration of recombinant TgPI-1 by intradermal and intranasal routes in order to enhance protection in the highly susceptible C57BL/6 strain. Mice primed intradermally with rTgPI-1 plus alum and boosted intranasally with rTgPI-1 plus CpG-ODN elicited a strong specific Th1/Th2 humoral response, along with a mucosal immune response characterized by specific-IgA in intestinal lavages. A positive cellular response of mesentheric lymph node cells and Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion in the ileon were also detected. When immunized mice were challenged with the cystogenic Me49 T. gondii strain, they displayed up to 62% reduction in brain parasite burden. Moreover, adoptive transfer of mesenteric lymph node cells from vaccinated to naive mice induced significant protection against infection. These results demonstrate that this strategy that combines the administration of TgPI-1 by two different routes, intradermal priming and intranasal boost, improves protective immunity against T. gondii chronic infection in highly susceptible mice.

      "Dermatophytosis in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus infection seems to manifest with atypical, multiple, or extensive lesions more frequently. In addition, there are reports of presentations with little inflammation, called anergics. Less common etiologic agents have been isolated in these individuals, such as Microsporum species. To describe clinical aspects and etiologic agents of dermatophytosis in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Patients with clinical diagnosis of dermatophytosis underwent scarification for mycological diagnosis through direct microscopic examination and fungal isolation in culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Sixty individuals had a clinical hypothesis of dermatophytosis. In 20 (33.3%) of the 60 patients, dermatophytosis was confirmed through a mycological study. Tinea corporis, diagnosed in 14 patients, was the most frequent clinical form, followed by tinea unguium in 7, tinea cruris in 5, and tinea pedis in 1 patient. Most of the lesions of tinea corporis were anergic. Five patients with tinea unguium had involvement of multiple nails, with onychodystrophy as the predominant subtype. Multiple cutaneous lesions occurred in 3 patients and extensive cutaneous lesions in 4. Regarding the agent, Trichophyton rubrum was the most commonly isolated. The high occurrence of anergic skin lesions and involvement of multiple nails, especially as onychodystrophy, corroborates the hypothesis that atypical, disseminated, and more severe presentations are common in individuals with HIV infection. However, no Microsporum species was isolated even in atypical, extensive, or disseminated cases, in disagreement with previous reports. Therefore, the approach of squamous lesions in HIV-positive patients must include a mycological study, in view of the possibility of anergic dermatophytosis, to promote the introduction of a suitable therapeutic agent.

      "Pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa and new insecticides with different modes of action are urgently needed. Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone mimic that reduces fecundity and fertility of adult Anopheles mosquitoes when used as a contact insecticide. A long-lasting insecticidal net incorporating pyriproxyfen is under development. As wild, host-seeking females may succeed in blood-feeding at different intervals after initial contact with mosquito nets the aim of this study was to determine the effect that age and gonotrophic status (nulliparous or parous) and the interval between initial pyriproxyfen exposure and blood-feeding has in terms of subsequent reduced fecundity and fertility. Anopheles gambiae s.s. were exposed to pyriproxyfen LLIN for three minutes in WHO cone bioassays. Four regimens were tested with different blood-feeding intervals A-1 hour (nulliparous), B-1 hour (parous), C-24h (nulliparous), or D-120h (nulliparous) after pyriproxyfen exposure. Mosquito oviposition rate, fecundity and fertility of eggs were recorded for several days. All four treatment regimens produced levels of mortality similar to unexposed females. The overall reduction in reproductive rate of 99.9% for regimen A relative to the untreated net was primarily due to oviposition inhibition in exposed females (97%). Pyriproxyfen was equally effective against older parous mosquitoes and when blood-feeding was 24h after exposure. Regimen D produced a reduction in reproductive rate of 60.1% but this was of lesser magnitude than other regimens and was the only regimen that failed to reduce fertility of laid eggs, indicating the effects of pyriproxyfen exposure on reproduction are to some extent reversible as mosquitoes age. In an area of moderate to high mosquito net coverage a host-seeking mosquito is likely to contact a treated mosquito net before: (a) penetrating a holed net and blood-feeding shortly after exposure or, (b) be frustrated by intact nets before succeeding in blood-feeding on an unprotected individual the following night. Mosquito nets are an appropriate delivery system for pyriproxyfen, based on the large reductions in reproductive rate when blood-feeding between 1h and 24h after exposure. Combining with a pyrethroid should be an effective approach if susceptible mosquitoes are killed and resistant mosquitoes sterilized. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Long term use of insecticides in malaria vector control has been shown to alter the behavior of vectors. Such behavioral shifts have the potential of undermining the effectiveness of insecticide-based control interventions. The effects of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) use on the composition, biting/feeding and sporozoite rates of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes in Musilongo village, Vihiga County of western Kenya highlands were investigated. Adult mosquitoes were collected in selected sleeping spaces inside six randomly selected houses using miniature Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps. Mosquito sampling in each house was conducted twice every week for 16 consecutive months (May 2010-August 2012). At each sampling a single trap was set in the selected space inside each house such that it collected mosquitoes alternatively from 18:00 to 21:00h and 21:00 to 06:00h every week. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically identified. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were classified according to their physiological status as unfed, fed, partially gravid and gravid, sorted and counted. Members of the A. gambiae complex were identified using a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine blood meal sources and Plasmodium infection rates in A. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes. Blood meal tests were conducted on DNA extracted from gut contents of blood fed A. gambiae s.l. The head and thorax section of dried samples of A. gambiae s.l. were used in testing for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites. Overall, 735 adult female Anopheles comprising 708 [96.3%] A. gambiae s.l. and 27 [3.7%] Anopheles funestus mosquitoes were collected. A. gambiae s.l. population collected comprised, 615 [86.9%] unfed and 38 [5.4%] fed adult mosquitoes. The rest were either partially or fully gravid. The proportion of A. gambiae s.l. biting indoors within 18:00-21:00h was 15.8% (103/653) at a rate of 3.2bites per person per hour compared to 84.2% biting from 21:00-06:00h at a rate of 3.8 bites/per/h. An estimated 97.7% A. gambiae ss and 2.3% A. arabiensis constituted the indoor biting A. gambiae s.l. The population of An. gambiae s.l. biting from 18:00 to 21:00h had a Plasmodium faciparum (pf) sporozoite rate of 3.8% compared to 3.5% observed in populations biting within 21:00-06:00h. Human blood constituted 89% of An. gambiae s.l. blood meal sources. The risk of malaria transmission from 21:00 to 06:00h was approximately 5 fold the risk within 18:00-21:00h. Majority of the infective female A. gambiae s.l. adults were biting deep into the night than in the early hours of the night. Humans remain the preferred source of blood meal for A. gambiae s.s. the dominant malaria vector in the highlands. ITNs remain a fundamental control intervention against malaria transmission since female blood seekers were more during bed time than pre-bed time. Advocacy on enhanced net availability, integrity and usage in Kenyan highlands can reduce Pf transmission. Additional complementary interventions are required to control the biting and parasite transmission encountered before bed-time. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Leishmania spp. is a protozoan that maintains its life cycle in domestic and wild animals and it may include bats, a population that has increased in urban environments. This study aimed to investigate the presence of Leishmania spp. in bats captured strictly in urban areas that are endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. The spleen and skin samples of 488 bats from 21 endemic cities in northwestern Sao Paulo State, Brazil, were tested for the presence of Leishmania kDNA using real-time PCR. Differentiation from Trypanosoma spp. was achieved by amplifying a DNA fragment of the ribosomal RNA gene. The presence of Leishmania spp. kDNA was verified in 23.9% of bats and Trypanosoma spp. DNA was identified in 3.9%. Leishmania species differentiation revealed the presence of Leishmania amazonensis in 78.3% of the bats; L. infantum in 17.4%, and 1 sample (4.3%) showed a mix pattern of L. infantum and L. amazonensis. We also detected, for the first time, L. infantum and L. amazonensis DNA in Desmodus rotundus, the hematophagous bat. The presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in bats strictly from urban areas endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil indicates that these wild and abundant animals are capable of harboring Leishmania spp. in this new scenario. Due to their longevity, high dispersion capacity and adaptability to synanthropic environments, they may play a role in the maintenance of the life cycle of Leishmania parasites.

      "The treatment of schistosomiasis depends on a single drug: praziquantel (PZQ). However, this treatment presents limitations such as low and/or erratic bioavailability that can contribute to cases of tolerance. Improvements to the available drug are urgently needed and studies with a controlled system of drug release, like liposomes, have been gaining prominence. The present study evaluated the activity and synergy between liposomal-praziquantel (lip.PZQ) and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO). Mice received doses of 60 or 100mg/kg PZQ or lip.PZQ, 50 days post-infection, and after the treatment, were exposed to HBO (3 atmosphere absolute - ATA) for 1h. The viability of adult worms and oviposition were analyzed, by necropsy and Kato-Katz examination performed after 15 days of treatment. A concentration of 100mg/kg of lip.PZQ+HBO was more effective (48.0% reduction of worms, 83.3% reduction of eggs/gram of feces) and 100% of the mice had altered of oograms (indicating interruption of oviposition) compared to other treatments and to the Control group (infected and untreated). It is known that PZQ requires participation of the host immune system to complete its antischistosomal activity and that HBO is able to stimulate the immune system. The drug became more available in the body when incorporated into liposomes and, used with HBO, the HBO worked as an adjuvant. This explains the decreases of oviposition and worms recovered form hepatic portal system. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1996614144\n",

      "Nuisance from Culex mosquitoes in Ghana has a serious negative impact on the standard of living in many urban communities. In addition, a perceived lack of efficacy of long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) against nuisance mosquitoes contributes to their discontinued use. This again compromises malaria control, even if Anopheles species themselves would still be susceptible to the insecticides used. Control strategies involve pyrethroid insecticides but information on Culex mosquito susceptibility to these insecticides is limited. A nationwide survey was conducted to address this problem. In adults, susceptibility to permethrin, deltamethrin and DDT as well as enzyme activity and kdr mutation were determined. Cone and tunnel bioassay were also carried out to determine the efficacy of LLINs against the mosquitoes. Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex decens were identified in the study area. Higher deltamethrin and DDT resistance and relatively low permethrin resistance were observed in both species. High enzyme activities and kdr mutations were observed in C. quinquefasciatus but not in C. decens. However, reduced efficacy of LLINs was observed in both mosquito species. This adds up to the evidence of the spread of pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes and its negative impact on control strategies. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Human infections with the helminth species Strongyloides stercoralis encompass a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to life-threatening disease. The diagnosis of S. stercoralis is cumbersome and the sensitivity of conventional stool microscopy is low. New molecular tools have been developed to increase sensitivity. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of real-time PCR with microscopy for the detection of S. stercoralis and hookworm in human stool samples, and investigated the inter-laboratory agreement of S. stercoralis-specific real-time PCR in two European laboratories. Stool specimens from 256 randomly selected individuals in rural Cote d'Ivoire were examined using three microscopic techniques (i.e. Kato-Katz, Koga agar plate (KAP) and Baermann (BM)). Additionally, ethanol-fixed stool aliquots were subjected to molecular diagnosis. The prevalence of S. stercoralis and hookworm infection was 21.9% and 52.0%, respectively, whilst co-infections were detected in 35 (13.7%) participants. The diagnostic agreement between real-time PCR and microscopy was excellent when both KAP and BM tested positive for S. stercoralis, but was considerably lower when only one microscopic technique was positive. The sensitivity of KAP, BM and real-time PCR for detection of S. stercoralis as compared to a combination of all diagnostic techniques was 21.4%, 37.5% and 76.8%, respectively. The inter-laboratory agreement of S. stercoralis-specific PCR was substantial (k=0.63, p<0.001). We conclude that a combination of real-time PCR and stool microscopy shows high accuracy for S. stercoralis diagnosis. Besides high sensitivity, PCR may also enhance specificity by reducing microscopic misdiagnosis of morphologically similar helminth larvae (i.e. hookworm and S. stercoralis) in settings where both helminth species co-exist.

      "The leishmaniases, a group of diseases with a worldwide-distribution, are caused by different species of Leishmania parasites. Both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis remain important public health problems in Ethiopia. Epidemiological cycles of these protozoans involve various sand fly (Diptera: Psychodidae) vectors and mammalian hosts, including humans. In recent years, Leishmania infections in bats have been reported in the New World countries endemic to leishmaniasis. The aim of this study was to survey natural Leishmania infection in bats collected from various regions of Ethiopia. Total DNA was isolated from spleens of 163 bats belonging to 23 species and 18 genera. Leishmania infection was detected by real-time (RT) PCR targeting a kinetoplast (k) DNA and internal transcribed spacer one (ITS1) gene of the parasite. Detection was confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products. Leishmania kDNA was detected in eight (4.9%) bats; four of them had been captured in the Aba-Roba and Awash-Methara regions that are endemic for leishmaniasis, while the other four specimens originated from non-endemic localities of Metu, Bedele and Masha. Leishmania isolates from two bats were confirmed by ITS1 PCR to be Leishmania tropica and Leishmania major, isolated from two individual bats, Cardioderma cor and Nycteris hispida, respectively. These results represent the first confirmed observation of natural infection of bats with the Old World Leishmania. Hence, bats should be considered putative hosts of Leishmania spp. affecting humans with a significant role in the transmission. Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study is to evaluate parasite-specific IgG and IgA levels using S. venezuelensis third-stage (L3) infective larvae alkaline extract as a heterologous antigen by ELISA in paired serum and saliva samples with improved sensitivity and specificity. Individuals from northern Parana state, Brazil were divided into three groups: 30 patients copropositive for S. stercoralis (Group I); 30 clinically healthy individuals (Group II); and 30 patients copropositive for other parasites (Group III). The area under ROC curve (AUC), an overall index of diagnostic accuracy, and Kappa index were calculated. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Kruskal-Wallis test. Probability (p) values of <0.05 were regarded as significant. In Group I, IgG was detected in 96.7% serum and in 6.7% saliva samples. IgG was not detected in Group II. In Group III, cross-reactivity was observed for serum IgG in 26.7% and in 6.7% for saliva samples. In Group I, IgA was detected in 76.7% serum and 56.7% saliva samples. In Group II, 3.3% were positive for IgA in serum, whereas IgA was not detected in any saliva samples. Group III showed 6.7% serum and 26.7% saliva-positive samples. The sensitivity values for detection of IgG and IgA in serum samples were 96.7% and 76.7%, respectively. In saliva samples, the sensitivity values for detection of IgG and IgA were 6.7% and 56.7%, respectively. The specificity value was 100% for the detection of IgG in serum and for detection of IgG and IgA in saliva, and 96.7% for detection of IgA in serum samples. The proper choice of immunological diagnosis to supplement parasitological methods is essential to estimate the true prevalence of the parasite, and will permit analysis of population immune response profiles, particularly in northern Parana state, where there are no previous reports.

      "We investigated the effects of predator-released kairomones on life history traits of larval Culex pipiens (Linnaeus). We compared the development time and survival of sibling larvae, reared in either water conditioned by the presence of Gambusia affinis (Baird and Girard) or fishless control-water. Our results indicate that larvae developing in fish-conditioned water (FCW) pupated faster than larvae in fishless-control water. The effect of FCW on larval survival was evident only in females. Surprisingly, FCW increased female survival. In both development-time and survival, boiling the water eliminated the FCW effect, supporting our hypothesis that fish conditioning is based on kairomones. Accelerated metamorphosis in response to predator released kairomones, evident in our results, is a rarely described phenomenon. Intuitively, when exposed to predator associated signals, aquatic larvae should metamorphose earlier to escape the higher risk of predation. However, theoretical models predict this outcome only under specific conditions. Indeed, longer - rather than shorter - time to metamorphosis is usually observed in response to predation risk. We argue that the response of larval mosquitoes to predation risk is context-dependent. Shortening larval development time may not be an exceptional response, but rather represents a part of a response spectrum that depends on the level of predation risk and resource abundance.

      "Urban parks are areas designated for human recreation but also serve as shelter and refuge for populations of several species of native fauna, both migratory and introduced. In Brazil, the effect of annual climate variations on Aedes aegypti and dengue epidemics in large cities like Sao Paulo is well known, but little is known about how such variations can affect the diversity of mosquito vectors in urban parks and the risk of disease transmission by these vectors. This study investigates the influence of larval habitats and seasonal factors on the diversity and abundance of Culicidae fauna in Anhanguera Park, one of the largest remaining green areas in the city of Sao Paulo. Species composition and richness and larval habitats were identified. Seasonality (cold-dry and hot-rainy periods) and year were considered as explanatory variables and the models selection approach was developed to investigate the relationship of these variables with mosquito diversity and abundance. A total of 11,036 specimens from 57 taxa distributed in 13 genera were collected. Culex nigripalpus, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus were the most abundant species. Bamboo internodes and artificial breeding sites showed higher abundance, while ponds and puddles showed greater richness. Significant relationships were observed between abundance and seasonality, with a notable increase in the mosquitos abundance in the warm-rainy periods. The Shannon and Berger-Parker indices were related with interaction between seasonality and year, however separately these predictors showed no relationship with ones. The increased abundance of mosquitoes in warm-rainy months and the fact that some of the species are epidemiologically important increase not only the risk of pathogen transmission to people who frequent urban parks but also the nuisance represented by insect bites. The findings of this study highlight the importance of knowledge of culicid ecology in green areas in urban environments. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1969376991\n",

      "Leishmaniases comprise zoonotic diseases caused by protozoan flagellates of the Leishmania genus. They are endemic to South America, and the visceral form has been recently reported in Argentina. Dogs can play different roles in the Leishmania transmission cycles, depending mainly on the species of parasite involved. Here we focused on the clinical characterization of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Northeast Argentina and on the molecular typing of its etiological agent. The nested polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of the Leishmania cytochrome b (cyt b) gene was performed on DNA templates purified from lymph nodes, bone marrow or spleen aspirates obtained from 48 dogs previously diagnosed by the observation of Leishmania amastigotes on smears from these aspirates. Their clinical and epidemiological data were also recorded. Systemic abnormalities were observed in 46 subjects (95.8%), most frequently lymphadenopathy, and emaciation (89.6 and 75%). Furthermore, 87% also presented tegumentary abnormalities, such as alopecia (54.2%) or secondary skin lesions (47.9%), among others. Twenty three dogs were positive for cyt b amplification. The sequence analysis showed the presence of two genotypes, LiA1 and LiA2, assigned to Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum, with 99.9 and 100% homology with the reference strain MHOM/TN/80/IPT1 respectively. LiA1 was identified in 18 cases (78.3%) and LiA2 in five (21.7%). Two cyt b variants of L.

This overview is based on articles published in the American Journal of Orthodontics, which frequently changed its name, over the past century. Additionally, other journals will be cited as craniofacial anomalies became recognized during the 20th century and the biologic basis became refined, with the new discipline of genetics replacing the term hereditary and its connotations of eugenics. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, has now provided an understanding of syndromic and nonsyndromic CLP that has led to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CLP in the 21st century. These evolving concepts will be discussed in an overview of the types of procedures published from 1915 to 2015 and the major transition in the mid-20th century from multiple uncoordinated interventions from various specialists to a coordinated team approach in which the orthodontist has a specific role in the timing and sequencing of interdisciplinary treatment goals. Major technologic advancements in treatment modalities and the contemporary approach to the health-related quality of life of the patient and the caregiver have resulted in their participation in treatment options and decisions. The requirement of informed consent reflects the legal doctrine that now emphasizes the ethical imperative of greater respect for patient autonomy in the decision-making process.

      "This article is a review that enumerates the causes of impaction of the maxillary permanent canines, including hard tissue obstructions, soft tissue lesions, and anomalies of neighboring teeth, and discusses the much-argued relationship between environmental and genetic factors. These phenomena have been shown in many investigations to accompany the diagnosis of canine impaction and have been presented as unrelated anomalous features, each of which is etiologically construed as genetic, including the aberrant canine itself. While in general the influence of genetics pervades the wider picture, a guidance theory proposes an alternative etiologic line of reasoning and interpretation of these studies, in which the same genetically determined anomalous features provide an abnormal milieu in which the canine is reared and from which it is guided in its misdirected and often abortive path of eruption.

      "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of orthodontic treatment on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in groups of standard patients with severe malocclusions; cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate patients; and orthognathic surgery patients. The study sample consisted of 83 consecutive patients undergoing treatment at the orthodontic unit of Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand, divided into 3 groups: 30 adolescents with severe malocclusions; 24 adolescents with cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate; and 29 adults with severe skeletal discrepancies requiring both orthognathic surgery and orthodontic treatment. Each patient completed the Short Form of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire before and after orthodontic treatment. The baseline OHIP-14 subscale scores among the 3 study groups were significantly different, with the surgery patients having nearly twice the OHIP-14 scores of the other 2 groups for nearly half of the items (P <0.05). The surgery patients experienced the greatest reduction in OHIP-14 scores (ie, improvement in OHRQoL), with the largest effect sizes reported for the psychological discomfort (+2.73) and disability (+2.65) domains. The group with clefts experienced the smallest changes in OHIP-14 scores across all 7 domains (-0.03 to +0.63). After adjusting for age and sex, the surgical patients had a significantly greater reduction in pretreatment OHIP-14 scores than did the standard and the cleft patients (P <0.01). The effect of orthodontic treatment on OHRQoL varies for different patient groups even after adjusting for age and sex. The greatest improvement in OHRQoL occurred in adults with a need for orthognathic surgery, whereas the least improvement seemed to occur in adolescents with cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate.

      "The craniofacial morphology of subjects with cleft lip and palate differs from that of subjects without clefts. Subjects with bilateral cleft lip and palate tend to have maxillary retrognathism, a smaller mandible with an obtuse gonial angle, greater anterior upper and lower facial heights, and retroclined maxillary incisors. The purposes of this research were to compare the skeletal and upper-airway features of subjects with bilateral cleft lip and palate with the same features in control subjects without clefts and to determine the growth-related changes at different growth stages. The sample comprised 212 subjects divided into 2 groups: 68 with bilateral cleft lip and palate, and 144 controls without clefts; each group was further divided into 4 subgroups according to growth stage using the cervical vertebral maturation stage method. The subgroups were defined as early childhood (stage 1), prepubertal (stage 2), pubertal (stage 3), and postpubertal (stage 4). The cephalometric variables were evaluated with 2-way analysis of variance and the Bonferroni test. Maxillary position showed no significant differences between the male groups. The maxilla was more prognathic at stage 2 and became more retrognathic at stages 3 and 4 in the females. The mandible was more retrusive in the bilateral cleft lip and palate subjects at stage 1 in males and at stages 3 and 4 in females. ANB was larger at stages 1 and 2, and it became similar to the controls at stages 3 and 4 in male and female bilateral cleft lip and palate subjects. Vertical growth was seen in the bilateral cleft lip and palate subjects regardless of sex, and no change was observed with age. Posterior airway space was narrower in all stages (except for stage 1 in females). Middle airway space was wider after stage 1 in the male and female bilateral cleft lip and palate subjects. Inferior airway space was narrower in the male bilateral cleft lip and palate patients at the early childhood and pubertal stages. Age- and sex-dependent differences in skeletal morphology and upper-airway widths of the bilateral cleft lip and palate subjects were identified when compared with the control subjects without clefts.

      "In this study, we evaluated root and alveolar bone development in unilateral osseous impacted immature maxillary central incisors by cone-beam computed tomography before and after closed-eruption treatment, in comparison with naturally erupted contralateral immature maxillary central incisors. The study included 30 patients, 20 boys and 10 girls, with a mean age of 8.44 +- 1.20 years (range, 6.5-11.2 years). After treatment, the root lengths of both the impacted maxillary central incisors (10.66 +- 2.10 mm) and the contralateral maxillary central incisors (11.04 +- 1.76 mm) were significantly greater than their pretreatment values (6.67 +- 1.94 and 9.02 +- 2.13 mm, respectively). The root canal widths of the incisors decreased significantly after treatment. From the posttreatment cone-beam computed tomography images, the ratio of exposed root length to total root length and the thickness of the alveolar bone at 1 mm under the alveolar crest and at the apex were calculated to evaluate alveolar bone development. Impacted immature maxillary central incisors differed significantly from contralateral immature maxillary central incisors in labial exposed root length, labial ratio to total root length, and lingual alveolar crest. Clinical crown height was higher (statistically but not clinically) for the impacted incisors (9.87 mm) than for the contralateral incisors (9.37 mm). Impacted immature incisors grew to the same stage as did erupted contralateral incisors after closed-eruption treatment. Both incisor types had some alveolar bone loss, and thin alveolar bone surrounded the roots. Copyright (c) 2015 American Association of Orthodontists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

      "The purposes of this study were to evaluate and compare the dentoskeletal changes concurrent with 4-point bone-borne and tooth-borne rapid maxillary expanders in growing children. The study was conducted with 20 growing girls (ages, 12 +- 0.6 years) with posterior crossbite. They were divided into 2 equal groups; patients in one group were treated with a tooth-borne maxillary hyrax expander (TBME), and those in the other group received a bone-borne maxillary hyrax expander (BBME) anchored directly to the palatal bone. Changes were assessed using cone-beam computed tomography. Images were taken before and immediately after expansion. Superimpositions of the 3-dimensional palatal images showed significant increases in skeletal widths at the canine, first premolar, and first molar areas in both groups. The TBME group had greater nasal width expansion. Regarding the transverse dentolinear measurements, significant increases were seen in both groups, whereas the TBME group showed a greater increase than the BBME group. Significant increases in the dentoangular measurements were seen in the TBME group only and were significantly greater than in the BBME group at the first premolars. There were significant increases in facial and maxillary widths for the BBME group and in nasal width for the TBME group. Both expanders produced basal bone expansion at the level of the hard palate. The TBMEs produced more dental expansion, buccal rolling, and a greater increase in nasal width than did the BBMEs. Copyright (c) 2015 American Association of Orthodontists.

      "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the rate of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) into bone-grafted alveolar defects based on different healing states. Ten male beagles were randomly allocated to 3 groups: group C, OTM alone as a control; group G, OTM into the grafted defects; group GL, OTM into the grafted defects with LLLT. The maxillary second premolars were protracted into the defects for 6 weeks, immediately (G-0 and GL-0) and at 2 weeks (G-2 and GL-2) after surgery. The defects were irradiated with a diode laser (dose, 4.5 J/cm(2)) every other day for 2 weeks. The rates of OTM and alveolar bone apposition, and maturational states of the defects were analyzed by histomorphometry, microcomputed tomography, and histology. The total amounts of OTM and new bone apposition rates were decreased by LLLT, with increased bone mineral density and trabecular maturation in the defects. Group GL-2 had the slowest movement with root resorption in relation to less woven bone in the hypermatured defect. LLLT significantly decreased the rate of OTM into the bone-grafted surgical defects by accelerating defect healing and maturation, particularly when the start of postoperative OTM was delayed.

      "The objective of this study was to assess the effect of baseline physical activity level on orthodontic pain perception and analgesic consumption after orthodontic separator placement in adolescents. One hundred fifty participants (mean age, 14.5 years; SD, 1.7 years; 73 girls, 77 boys) were included in this longitudinal study. The physical activity questionnaire was used to assess their baseline physical activity levels. Once participants completed the questionnaire, orthodontic separators were placed at the mesial and distal contact points of the maxillary and mandibular first molars. A 100-mm visual analog scale was used for pain assessment. Analgesic consumption was recorded as a binary response (yes/no). Both outcomes were assessed at 1 baseline time point and 7 follow-up time points (bedtime on days 1 to 7). A multilevel mixed-effect model analysis approach was used to analyze the longitudinal data. Of the 150 participants in the study, data from 137 were included in the analysis (mean age, 14.4 years; SD, 1.7 years; 65 girls, 72 boys). Compared with the low-activity group (84 participants; 61.3%), the high-activity group (53 participants; 38.7%) experienced significantly less pain (mean estimate, -8.958; P = 0.0114; 95% confidence interval, -15.868 to -2.049) and consumed fewer analgesics (odds ratio, 0.443; P <0.0318; 95% confidence interval, 0.199 to 0.786) during the study period. Physical activity has a significant influence on orthodontic pain perception and analgesic consumption in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment.

      "Medicaid is a needs-based program in the United States that subsidizes medical and dental care for minors. The purpose of this study was to test for compliance differences between self-pay and Medicaid-supported patients. Medicaid patient records (n = 88) were perused retrospectively for characteristics that distract from an orthodontist's workflow (missed appointments, broken brackets, treatment duration, and so on) and compared with a sample (n = 145) of self-pay patients from the same teaching clinic. Differences in treatment difficulty were adjusted by subject selection and statistically (analysis of covariance). Medicaid patients were younger (mean age, 14.1 vs 14.9 years) and significantly more likely to be dismissed from treatment (19% vs 4%), generally for noncompliance. Broken brackets and missed appointments were more common in the Medicaid sample. There was no difference in the number of appointments in those completing treatment, but treatment duration was significantly longer for the Medicaid patients who completed treatment (29 vs 25 months). Commute distance and estimated driving time were significantly shorter for the Medicaid-assisted group. Greater difficulty in managing Medicaid patients may partly explain why they are underserved.

      "Variations in treatment times for serial extraction and late premolar extraction patients may be due to differences in the time needed to flatten the occlusal curves. In this study, we compared tooth tipping and occlusal curves in patients treated by serial extractions or late premolar extractions with untreated controls. Mandibular dental casts and cephalometric radiographs were collected from 90 subjects (30 Class I control subjects, 30 patients with serial extractions, and 30 with late premolar extractions) at 3 time points: T0, baseline for the controls and serial extraction patients; T1, after natural drift and preorthodontics for the controls and the serial extraction patients, and pretreatment for the late premolar extraction patients; and T2, after comprehensive orthodontic treatment for the serial extraction and the late premolar extraction groups. The long axes of the central incisor, canine, and first molar to the palatal plane were measured on digitized headfilms to determine the direction and the amount of tipping between the time points. Three occlusal curves were measured by sphere fitting cusp-tip landmarks on digitized mandibular casts. From T0 to T1, incisors and canines in the patients with serial extractions tipped distally. Molars at T1 in the patients with serial extractions were tipped forward more than in the late premolar extraction patients and the controls. From T1 to T2, canines and molars in the patients with serial extractions were uprighted. Serial extractions produce steeper occlusal curves and distal tipping of the incisors and canines after drift (T1). Posttreatment (T2) occlusal curves in the patients with serial extractions are steeper than in the late premolar extraction patients and controls (except for the curve of Spee). After the serial extractions, orthodontic treatment included incisor and canine proclination, with molar uprighting and occlusal curve flattening.

      "The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effects of facemask protraction combined with alternating rapid palatal expansion and constriction (RPE/C) vs rapid palatal expansion (RPE) alone in the early treatment of maxillary retrusive patients. Patients with a midface deficiency were recruited and randomly allocated into either the control group (RPE) or the intervention group (RPE/C). Eligibility criteria included the following: age 7 to 13 years old, Class III malocclusion, anterior crossbite, ANB less than 0deg, Wits appraisal less than -2 mm, A-Np less than 0 mm, and no cleft of lip or palate. The primary outcome was the degree of maxillary forward movement after treatment. The secondary outcomes were the changes of the other cephalometric variables after treatment and the treatment time. Simple randomization was carried out using a random number table at the beginning of the study. Envelopes containing the grouping information were used to ensure allocation concealment from the researchers. Blinding was applicable for cephalometric analysis only. Hyrax palatal expanders and facemask maxillary protraction were used in all patients. Patients in the RPE group were treated with rapid palatal expansion for 1 week. Patients in the RPE/C group were treated with RPE/C for 7 weeks. The expansion or constriction rate was 1 mm per day. Cephalometric analysis with traditional cephalometric measurements and an x-y coordinate system were used to compare the pretreatment and posttreatment cephalometric radiographs. Independent t tests were used to compare the data between the 2 groups. A total of 44 patients were randomized to either the RPE group or the RPE/C group in a 1:1 ratio. One subject in the RPE group was lost to follow-up during the treatment. Per-protocol analysis was used. All the other 43 patients reached the treatment completion criteria and were analyzed (RPE group: n = 21; RPE/C group: n = 22). The average protraction time was 10.84 months in the RPE group, which was significantly longer than that in the RPE/C group (9.06 months) (effect size [ES], 1.78 [95% CI, 0.15, 3.42; P = 0.033]). Maxillary forward movement increased by 3.04 mm in the RPE/C group, which was significantly greater than that in the RPE group (2.11 mm) (ES, -0.93 [95% CI, -1.65, -0.20; P = 0.013]). The counterclockwise rotation of the palatal plane was 1.73deg in the RPE/C group, which was significantly greater than that in the RPE group (0.83deg) (ES, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.08, 1.73; P = 0.033]). The degree of mandibular downward and backward rotation was significantly smaller in the RPE/C group (P <0.05). No serious harm was observed during treatment and research. Facemask maxillary protraction with RPE/C might positively affect the forward movement of the maxilla compared with facemask protraction with RPE alone in the early treatment of maxillary retrusive patients. Although the differences between the groups were statistically significant for forward movement of the maxilla and rotation of the palatal and mandibular planes, these may not be clinically relevant, since the differences were less than 1 mm and 1deg, respectively. This trial was not registered. The protocol was not published before trial commencement. This research was supported by Peking University Research Fund. No conflict of interest is declared.

      "Our objective was to identify factors associated with orthodontic treatment satisfaction of patients and their caregivers, when applicable. MEDLINE via Ovid, PubMed, EBM Reviews and EMBASE via OVIDSP, LILACS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched electronically. Reference lists of included articles were also screened for potential relevant studies missed during the electronic searches. Studies evaluating the satisfaction levels of patients or caregivers after orthodontic treatment were considered. Methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Eighteen studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing 2891 patients and 464 parents. The risk of bias was moderate in 13 and low in 4 of the included articles. The studies used different questionnaires and timings to assess postorthodontic treatment satisfaction. Based on the available limited evidence, satisfaction was associated with perceived esthetic outcomes, psychological benefits, and quality of care. The latter was specifically linked to dentist-staff-patient interactions. Dissatisfaction was associated with treatment duration, pain levels and discomfort, and the use of retention appliances. When both assessments were available, the patient's and the parent's satisfaction levels were strongly correlated. Based on the limited available evidence with moderate risk of bias, we identified factors that appear to be more commonly associated with a high or low level of satisfaction. Consideration of these factors could be important for practitioners attempting to set realistic expectations of their patients and caregivers regarding orthodontic treatment outcomes.

      "A mandibular functional shift usually poses a challenge for orthodontists, especially when it is accompanied by a temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Accurate diagnosis and complete elimination of the etiologic factors are the keys to an esthetic and stable outcome. This article describes the treatment of a teenager with a mandibular functional shift, TMD symptoms, and facial asymmetry resulting from an asymmetric maxillary arch form and multiple crossbites as occlusal interferences. The treatment alternatives and effective orthodontic techniques are described. To optimize the treatment results and prevent the recurrence of the TMD after treatment, the displaced mandible was repositioned by full-time wearing of a splint for 10 months. Adhesive bite-blocks were used to maintain the newly acquired mandibular position during fixed appliance treatment. A series of nickel-titanium and stainless steel rectangular archwires was placed in the maxillary arch to reshape it for 8 months after alignment. Finally, the displaced mandible was steadily seated into its physiologic position with fine occlusion. The TMD symptoms disappeared and never relapsed after treatment. At 2 years 3 months of retention, there was good stability. The combined splint and fixed appliance approach resolved an intractable clinical problem and avoided using additional appliances. An esthetic, functional, and stable outcome was achieved that satisfied both the patient and his parents. Copyright (c) 2015 American Association of Orthodontists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

      "Our objective was to measure the impact on perceived root resorption based on the amount of anteroposterior incisal inclination as determined in vitro from conventional panoramic radiography. A rapid prototyping model was created to mimic different maxillary and mandibular incisal anteroposterior inclinations. Two titanium beads were placed on the incisors at the apical and incisal edges. Panoramic radiographs were obtained, with the incisors changing relative inclination by 10deg increments. The length was measured from the midpoint of the bead on the incisal edge to the midpoint of the bead on the apical edge. By using a length of wire of known size, this value was compared in all images to correct for image magnification. Changes to mandibular incisor anteroposterior inclinations, as either a theoretical proclination or retroclination, resulted in an increase of \"\"apparent\"\" root resorption on a panoramic radiograph. When the maxillary incisors were significantly and severely retroclined, they appeared larger than expected. When the maxillary incisors were mildly retroclined, the length was roughly similar to the theoretical model. When the maxillary incisors were mildly proclined, they appeared shorter than expected. The foreshortening or forelengthening of incisor root lengths because of incisor inclination vs root resorption cannot be reliably evaluated from panoramic images. The proposed theoretical model helps to understand the direction of the changes produced by the magnification factor. More severe scenarios where either the maxillary or the mandibular teeth are outside the focal trough have not been fully evaluated. The clinical impact of these changes is likely to be questionable.

Retrospective study. University Assisted Reproductive Unit. Forty patients were recruited, 20 women with an elevated P level, and 20 women with a normal P level, into cancelled embryo transfer (ET) cycles. Endometrial biopsy samples were obtained from women who had an elevated or normal P level 7 days after human chorionic gonadotropin administration. The protein expression levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and PLGF were examined using immunohistochemistry. A semiquantitative analysis was performed using histochemical-score analysis of staining intensity in the luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium, and stroma, separately. Luminal epithelial expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, and PLGF did not significantly differ in women with elevated or normal P levels before oocyte retrieval. Glandular epithelial expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and PLGF was higher in women with elevated P levels, compared with those with normal P levels. A significantly higher stromal expression of VEGF-A and PLGF was found in women with elevated P levels. A high P level before oocyte retrieval was associated with expression of VEGF angiogenic factors in glandular epithelium and stromal compartment around the time of embryo implantation. Our findings suggest that the lower implantation rates observed in this group of women may relate to decreased endometrial receptivity arising from altered expression of angiogenic factors.

Varying amounts of oocytes retrieved in autologous and donor IVF. Ectopic pregnancy rates. In autologous cycles, the EP rate significantly increased as oocyte yield increased. This association was not found in oocyte recipients. In autologous IVF cycles, increasing oocyte yield is correlated with a significantly increased EP rate. This association is not found in oocyte recipients, indicating that the increased EP rate may be due to the supraphysiologic hormone levels achieved with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.

Three thousand eight hundred thirty-five embryos generated from 629 couples undergoing IVF. None. Incidence of aneuploidy in the trophectoderm of blastocyst embryos derived from standard IVF embryos and intracytoplasmic (ICSI) males with normal and oligozoospermic semen samples, in couples with donor eggs (mean maternal age, 25.0 years) and their own eggs (mean maternal age, 35.4 years). The rate of sex chromosome aneuploidy was significantly (around threefold) higher in the oligozoospermic group compared with in both control groups (standard vs. ICSI insemination). This applied whether donor (young) or own (older) eggs were used. Significant differences were seen in the oligozoospermic samples for autosomes 1, 2, 11 (own eggs), and 18 (donor eggs) compared with both control groups; however, no significant difference was seen between each of the treatment groups for the overall rate of autosomal aneuploidy. No significant differences were seen between the two control groups (normozoospermic males, standard vs. ICSI insemination) in either of the egg group types for any chromosome pairs. Severe male factor infertility is associated with a significant increase in the occurrence of sex chromosome abnormalities in blastocyst embryos compared with in embryos derived from normal semen samples. Aneuploidy rates in embryos derived from sperm with normal parameters were not significantly different whether ICSI or standard insemination was used to achieve fertilization.

Between cycles 1 and 2, 11.9% switched from normal to low or high response, and 12.5% switched from low or high to normal response; 75.6% remained in the same category. Between cycles 2 and 3, 15.9% switched from normal to low or high response, and 10.2% switched from low or high to normal response; 73.9% remained in the same category. These shifts are symmetrical in nature, in that the percentage of subjects who shift from normal to low or high response is comparable to the percentage of subjects who shift from low or high to normal response. Baseline FSH and AFC did not significantly predict transition in ovarian response. The variability in ovarian responses between repeated cycles using the same protocol was not explained by baseline FSH and AFC. NCT00696878 Protocol P05714.

      "To assess the accuracy of antimullerian hormone (AMH) in predicting cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) within 1 year after treatment initiation in GnRH antagonist treatment cycles for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Observational (retrospective) substudy as part of an ongoing prospective cohort study. University medical center. A total of 487 patients scheduled for IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Patients starting their first IVF/ICSI cycle with 150 or 225 IU recombinant FSH and GnRH antagonist cotreatment were included. Serum samples collected before the first IVF treatment were used to determine AMH. Treatment data after treatment initiation for a maximum of 1 year were recorded. Prediction of CLBR with the use of AMH. The model for predicting CLBR within 1 year included age at first treatment, AMH, type of infertility, and previous assisted reproductive technology treatment leading to live birth. The accuracy in discriminating between women who did or did not achieve a live birth was only 59%. AMH had intermediate added value in the prediction of CLBR as demonstrated by the net reclassification improvement (total 29.8). A nomogram based on age and AMH was developed by which a subgroup of patients could be identified with the poorest pregnancy prospects. The predictive accuracy of AMH for 1-year CLBR in GnRH antagonist treatment cycles was limited and did not yield much additional value on top of age. Withholding treatment based on predictors such as age and AMH, or a combination, remains problematic. www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02309073.

      "To develop a diagnostic tool for embryo implantation potential with the use of proteomic fingerprinting combined with time-lapse morphokinetic analysis. Retrospective cohort study. University-affiliated private in vitro fertilization center. Seventeen infertile patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) from our ovum donation program. No patient intervention. We examined morphokinetic data and proteomic data from the spent media of 16 embryos that implanted and 12 embryos that did not implant. We analyzed seven proteins in the embryo spent media-SCF, TNFR1, PIGF-1, IFN-a2, IL-6, CXCL13, and GM-CSF-with the use of a bead-based multiplexing technology and combined this data with the exact timing (in hours) of cell cycle duration (cc2), blastomere synchrony (s2), and 5-blastomere cleavage (t5) with the use of an incubator equipped with time-lapse videography. Logistic regression analysis with the use of the forward-step likelihood selection method revealed that the presence/absence of interleukin (IL) 6 and the duration of cc2 were the most relevant embryo features for embryo selection. We combined these two parameters to obtain a hierarchic model that established four categories (A/B/C/D), based on the presence of IL-6 and a cc2 range of 5-12 hours. A direct relationship was observed between the morphologic categories and implantation rates: Those with the presence of IL-6 and 5-12 h cc2 had significantly higher implantation rates. The strategy we report here combines time-lapse and proteome analysis to improve embryo selection while minimizing handling and monitoring by the embryologist. Our results describe the utility of a combined biochemical/morphokinetic approach to select embryos for transfer according to their implantation potential. Clinical validation with larger sample sizes is mandatory to confirm the effectiveness of this initial study. Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Experimental laboratory study. University. Patients with endometriosis (n = 61), laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis-free women (n = 35), and self-reported healthy women (n = 30) were included in the study. None. Plasma miRNA levels in endometriosis patients and control subjects. We found that the levels of studied miRNAs varied with blood collection time, being lower in the morning than in the evening. When blood collection time was taken into account, the results revealed significantly lower levels of miR-200a and miR-141 in the evening plasma samples of women with endometriosis compared with surgically confirmed disease-free patients. However, the evening-sample levels of all three miRNAs were significantly lower in patients with stage I-II endometriosis than in endometriosis-free control subjects. In cases of stage III-IV endometriosis, only miR-200a levels were significantly lower compared with patients without endometriosis. Circulating miR-200a showed the best discriminative power to differentiate women with endometriosis from patients with similar complaints but without the disease. Our findings suggest that miR-200a and miR-141 have a potential as novel noninvasive biomarkers for endometriosis. In addition, we found that the plasma miR-200a, miR-200b and miR-141 levels vary with blood sampling time, so it is important to take the sample collection time into account when studying miRNAs as biomarkers.

Total and specific types of meat intake were estimated from dietary questionnaires. Fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live-birth rates per initiated cycle. Mixed-effects models account for multiple IVF cycles per woman. There was a positive association between poultry intake and fertilization rate, with a 13% higher fertilization rate among men in the highest quartile of poultry intake compared with those in the lowest quartile (78% vs. 65%). Processed meat intake was inversely related to fertilization rate in conventional IVF cycles but not in IVF cycles using intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The adjusted fertilization rates for men in increasing quartiles of processed meat intake were 82%, 67%, 70%, and 54% in conventional IVF cycles. Men's total meat intake, including intake of specific types of meat, was not associated with implantation, clinical pregnancy, or live-birth rates. Poultry intake was positively associated with fertilization rates, whereas processed meat intake was negatively associated with fertilization rates among couples undergoing conventional IVF. This, however, did not translate into associations with clinical pregnancy or live-birth rates. Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Case-control observational study. Academic fertility practice. Women with two or more pregnancy losses. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining was performed on all endometrial biopsies and plasma cells were identified by morphology. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for CD138 was later applied to all tissue samples. Charts were reviewed to evaluate the outcome of the next clinical intrauterine pregnancy. Miscarriage rate and live birth rate. A total of 107 women met inclusion criteria. The use of CD138 IHC staining resulted in a significantly higher prevalence of CE compared with the use of H & E staining and morphological assessment alone (56% [60/107] vs. 13% [14/107]). The 51 women with untreated CE were compared with the 45 women without CE by CD138 staining. Among those women with a subsequent pregnancy, the live birth rate in the next clinical intrauterine pregnancy after endometrial evaluation was 67.6% (23/34) in women with untreated CE and 87.1% (27/31) in women without CE. Age, body mass index (BMI), results of RPL evaluation, and number of prior losses were not significantly different between the two groups. CD138 IHC staining of endometrial biopsies in women with RPL provides increased sensitivity when screening for CE compared with H & E staining and morphological assessment alone. Untreated CE may contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes and deserves further investigation in a larger cohort. Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

After the collection of FF and granulosa cells from each patient, the samples were processed for total RNA extraction. RNA was pooled into different groups (three samples per pool) for microarray analysis to evaluate the expression of a total of 866 human miRNAs. Individual samples were analyzed to validate the pooled microarray results using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Evaluation of the expression of a total of 866 human miRNAs in FF and granulosa cells. We identified only one differentially expressed miRNA, hsa-miR-424, which is present in higher proportions in FF from patients with advanced age. When we compared the FF from metaphase II (MII) versus GV (germinal vesicle) oocytes, we found 13 differentially expressed miRNAs (two up- and 11 downregulated). When we compared FF from MII versus MI, we found seven differentially expressed miRNAs in MII (three up- and four downregulated). We have described the FF miRNA profiles according to IVF patients' age and the maturation stage of their oocytes. This descriptive study may aid our understanding of the physiology and regulation of oocyte maturation and could identify some potential miRNA biomarkers for this process. Not applicable.

Basic semen parameters tracked included sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), the expression levels of 75 protein kinases, and the phosphorylation/cleavage patterns of 18 signaling proteins in human spermatozoa. The results indicated that the phosphorylated levels of several proteins (Bad, GSK-3b, HSP27, JNK/SAPK, mTOR, p38 MAPK, and p53), as well as cleavage of PARP (at D214) and Caspase-3 (at D175), were significantly correlated with motility parameters. Additionally, the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa demonstrated a significant positive correlation with the phosphorylated levels of p70 S6 kinase and, in turn, head defects and the teratozoospermia index (TZI) showed a significant negative correlation with the phosphorylated levels of Stat3. There was a significant positive correlation between SDF and the teratozoospermia index, as well as the presence of head defects. In contrast, SDF negatively correlated with the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa and the phosphorylation of Akt and p70 S6 kinase. Subjects with varicocele demonstrated a significant negative correlation between head morphological defects and the phosphorylated levels of Akt, GSK3b, p38 MAPK, and Stat1.

An original technique of combined laparoscopic and vaginal cervicovaginal reconstruction using split thickness skin graft for cervicovaginal reconstruction. A midline incision at the vaginal introitus was made, and a 9-cm canal was made between the bladder and the rectum using sharp and blunt dissection along the anatomic vaginal route, with the aid of laparoscopy to ensure correct orientation. A 14 x 12 cm split thickness skin graft was harvested from the right lateral thigh. By laparoscopy, the level of the lowest pole of the uterine cavity was exposed and the cervix was incised by shape dissection. The proximal segment of the harvested skin to the lower uterine segment was secured, and the distal segment was sutured with the upper margin of vulva vaginally. Surgical technique reports in anonymous patients are exempted from ethical approval by the Institutional Review Board. The patient gave consent to use the video in the article.

Treatment with dichloroacetate (0, 20, 40, and 80 mg/mL, 24 hours). The expression of SOD3, iNOS, and NO levels were measured utilizing real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Greiss assay. The Dpsm was evaluated by the JC-1 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay. Apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 activity and TUNEL assays. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0. Mixed model repeated-measures analysis of variance was used with a Bonferroni correction. Significant interactions were analyzed with independent sample t tests. Dichloroacetate increased apoptosis, SOD3 messenger RNA, iNOS messenger RNA, and NO levels in fibroblasts from peritoneum and adhesions. There was enhanced Dpsm adhesion as compared with normal peritoneal fibroblasts. Creating oxidative stress by exposure by hypoxia markedly increased Dpsm in fibroblasts from normal peritoneum to levels observed in adhesions; dichloroacetate protected against the effects of hypoxia. Anaerobic metabolism and oxidative stress are associated with the development of the adhesion phenotype, which manifests decreased apoptosis. Dichloroacetate induces adhesion fibroblasts to undergo apoptosis via modulation of redox homeostasis.

By independent screening of titles and abstracts, two investigators selected original studies examining the influence of paternal age on oocyte donation outcomes. Twelve articles were included, encompassing a total of 12,538 oocyte-donation cases. No statistically significant correlation was found by most studies between advanced paternal age and the rate of fertilization, cleavage embryo development, implantation, pregnancy, miscarriage, or live birth. A statistically significant decrease in blastocyst embryo formation was suggested in two articles. Except for volume and possibly motility, other sperm characteristics such as concentration and morphology did not alter with age. However, the overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria. The available evidence suggests that advancing paternal age is not associated with adverse oocyte donation outcomes, including pregnancy and live-birth rates. However, the suboptimal quality of the available evidence necessitates high-quality, well-adjusted prospective trials that are also aimed at evaluating additional outcomes such as congenital anomalies and various specific long-term disorders.

Significantly more DNMT3B bound to the SF-1 promoter in E-IUM compared with E-OSIS, and IVD treatment reduced binding in E-IUM to levels similar to those in E-OSIS. Enrichment of DNMT3B across 3 ESR1 promoters was reduced in E-IUM after IVD, although the more-distal promoter showed increased DNMT3B enrichment in E-OSIS after IVD. The inability to downregulate DNMT3B expression in E-OSIS may contribute to an aberrant epigenetic fingerprint that misdirects gene expression in endometriosis and contributes to its altered response to steroid hormones.

A total of 413 men provided semen and urine samples, 2005-2009. Five UV filters were quantified (ng/mL) in urine using liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry: BP-1 (2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone), BP-2 (2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxybenzophenone), BP-3 (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone), BP-8 (2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone), and 4-OH-BP (4-hydroxybenzophenone). Using linear regression, b-coefficients (b) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each chemical dichotomized at the 75th percentile and Box-Cox transformed semen endpoint were estimated, after adjusting for age, body mass index, cotinine, season, and site. None. Thirty-five semen endpoints. BP-2 was associated with diminished sperm concentration (b = -0.74; 95% CI -1.41, -0.08), straight (b = -4.57; 95% CI -8.95, -0.18) and linear movement (b = -3.15; 95% CI -6.01, -0.30), more immature sperm (b = 0.38; 95% CI 0.15, 0.62), and a decreased percentage of other tail abnormalities (b = -0.16; 95% CI -0.31, -0.01). BP-8 was associated with decreased hypo-osmotic swelling (b = -2.57; 95% CI -4.86, -0.29) and higher acrosome area (b = 1.14; 95% CI 0.01, 2.26). No associations were observed for BP-1, BP-3, or 4OH-BP. The findings suggest that specific UV filters may be associated with some aspects of semen endpoints, but await future corroboration.

A retrospective, population-based study. Not applicable. A total of 50,788 infants conceived after ART treatment performed from 2009 to 2012. None. The rates of preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA) for 43,952 singleton and 3,418 twin deliveries after transfers of blastocyst or cleavage-stage embryos. Among singletons, there was no significant difference in the odds of preterm birth between blastocyst and cleavage-stage ET (9.1% compared with 9.3%, respectively, adjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.08). Among twins, the crude rates of preterm birth were similar after blastocyst and cleavage-stage ETs (61.5% and 64.4%, respectively). However, after adjusting for potential confounders, blastocyst transfer was associated with a lower odds of preterm birth among twins (adjusted odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.70-0.93). There was no difference in risks of LBW and SGA between blastocyst and cleavage-stage ETs for both singletons and twins after adjusting for potential confounders. In contrast with the findings from a number of other studies, blastocyst culture in Australian and New Zealand is not associated with an increased risk of preterm, LBW, and SGA for singletons. Further studies are needed to assess longer-term outcomes of children born after ART treatment and possible biological or treatment factors related to adverse outcomes.

Analysis of prospectively collected data. Academic medical center. All ART-conceived pregnancies between January 1995 and June 2013. Early pregnancy monitoring via clinical algorithm with all pregnancies screened using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels and reported symptoms, with subsequent early ultrasound evaluation if hCG levels were abnormal or if the patient reported pain or vaginal bleeding. Algorithmic efficiency for diagnosis of EP and HP and their subsequent clinical outcomes using a binary forward stepwise logistic regression model built to determine predictors of early pregnancy failure. Of the 3,904 pregnancies included, the incidence of EP and HP was 0.77% and 0.46%, respectively. The algorithm selected 96.7% and 83.3% of pregnancies diagnosed with EP and HP, respectively, for early ultrasound evaluation, leading to earlier treatment and resolution. Logistic regression revealed that first hCG, second hCG, hCG slope, age, pain, and vaginal bleeding were all independent predictors of early pregnancy failure after ART. Our clinical algorithm for early pregnancy evaluation after ART is effective for identification and prompt intervention of EP and HP without significant over- or misdiagnosis, and avoids the potential catastrophic morbidity associated with delayed diagnosis.

      "Although endometriosis is well recognized as a benign gynecologic condition, its association with ovarian cancer (OVCA) has frequently been reported. Review articles on this topic are voluminous, yet there seems to be no consensus as to whether endometriosis is truly a precursor of OVCA and whether any screening or risk-reducing surgery should be instituted, on the basis of our current knowledge. In this review, published data are compiled and critically appraised. Through this critical appraisal, it seems clear that the strongest evidence seems to come from prevalence data. This type of data also suggests a reduced risk of certain histotypes (mainly type II) of OVCA in women with endometriosis. This may explain the rather moderate increase in risk as shown in epidemiologic studies. Even with this moderate increase in OVCA risk, caution should be exercised because of apparent bias in favor of publication of positive results, extensive heterogeneities among prevalence estimates, and inverse relationship between estimates and sizes of the studies. Many molecular studies are conflicting, and earlier studies showing molecular aberrations involved in genomic instability and mutation that enable malignant transformation are not replicated in later studies. Given the low incidence of OVCA and the rather moderate increase in risk of mostly type I tumors, screening seems to be ill-advised, and risk-reducing surgery such as salpingectomy with or without oophorectomy does not seem to yield any substantial benefit to women with endometriosis.

      "Deep endometriosis is a demanding condition that is associated with infertility. However, evidence supporting a direct link between deep endometriosis and infertility is weak. In fact, infertility in affected patients is more likely to be explained by the strong association between deep endometriosis and adhesions, superficial endometriotic implants, ovarian endometriomas, and adenomyosis. The purported beneficial effects of surgery on infertility are mainly based on the 40%-42% pregnancy rate (PR) after surgery observed in published case series. However, this level of evidence is questionable and overestimates the benefits of the intervention. Even if comparative studies are lacking, IVF may be a valid alternative. The procedure may be less effective in affected women compared with other indications and it is not without additional deep endometriosis-related risks. Some case reports suggest that lesions might progress during IVF causing ureteral or intestinal complications or can decidualize during pregnancy causing intestinal perforation, pneumothorax, and pelvic vessels rupture. Finally, in the decision-making process, physicians should also consider that women with a history of deep endometriosis may face an increased risk of pregnancy complications. In conclusion, clear recommendation for the management of infertile women with deep endometriosis cannot be extrapolated from the literature. The therapeutic decision should be based on a comprehensive evaluation that includes clinical history, instrumental findings, pain symptoms, risks of pregnancy complications, and the woman's wishes.

      "The risk of pregnancy and neonatal complications in women with endometriosis and adenomyosis is debatable. A literature review looking at rates, presentation, and management of spontaneous hemoperitoneum, enlargement, abscess, and rupture of an endometrioma, uterine rupture, and bowel perforation in pregnant women with endometriosis was conducted. Moreover, studies addressing differences in early pregnancy (miscarriage), late pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, prematurity, placenta previa, placental abruption, cesarean section, hemorrhages) and neonatal outcomes (weight at birth) between endometriosis and adenomyosis patients versus control subjects were reviewed. The overall prevalence of endometriosis-related spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy is estimated to be ~0.4%. Only four cases of endometrioma rupture in pregnancy have been reported. Although during pregnancy there is no way to anticipate the onset of complications from preexisting endometriosis, it is important, when a specific abdominal pain occurs, to suspect rare but potentially life-threating events. Population-based studies suggest a possible association of endometriosis with preterm birth and placenta previa. Limits of the published studies are noted and discussed. Copyright (c) 2015.

      "Although surgical excision of endometriosis both improves pain and enhances fertility, recurrence can further exacerbate pain and reduce fertility, which in turn impacts the quality of life and increases personal as well as social costs. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent the recurrence of symptoms and lesions after conservative surgery. This article reviews evidence regarding the prevention of postoperative recurrence of endometriosis reported since the 1990s. Over the past 5 years, many new studies have been conducted and have demonstrated that long-term postoperative medication markedly reduces the recurrence. Most of these studies used oral contraceptives (OC), with either the cyclic or continuous regimen, while some used oral or intrauterine progestin. Continuous OC is more efficacious than cyclic OC, especially for dysmenorrhea. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is also shown to prevent recurrence of dysmenorrhea and possibly endometriosis lesions. Dienogest, a new progestin, is shown to reduce the recurrence of endometrioma. Similar to the case of ovarian endometriosis, long-term postoperative medication after conservative surgery for deep infiltrating or extragenital endometriosis seems important, although data are limited. Regardless of the lesion and the medication type, patients who discontinued medication experienced a higher incidence of recurrence, indicating that the protective effect of these medications seems to vanish rapidly after the discontinuation. On the basis of these facts, together with the pathogenesis of recurrence (retrograde menstruation and ovulation), regular and prolonged medication until the patient wishes to conceive is highly recommended to prevent the postoperative recurrence of endometriosis.

      "Endometriosis is a protean disease, and its manifestations, associated clinical problems, and possible treatments are numerous. Deep endometriosis that infiltrates multiple pelvic organs should be considered the most severe endometriotic form that poses the most difficult therapeutic uncertainties in both infertility and pelvic pain symptoms limiting quality of life. The available evidence demonstrates that endometriosis is not only a gynecologic disorder but, contrary to previous belief, its impact extends into pregnancy, delivery, and the post-partum period. The old clinical tenet that pregnancy is a cure for endometriosis may be revealed as fallacious. Safe and effective modalities to reduce the risk of the recurrence of symptoms and lesions after conservative surgery for endometriosis are now available. These treatment options should be offered post-operatively to women not immediately seeking conception. Endometriosis is associated with a moderate increase in ovarian cancer risk. However, as there are no definitive demonstrations that endometriosis constitutes per se a pre-neoplastic condition, it seems currently unwise to set-up a screening program to detect undiagnosed endometriosis in asymptomatic women. Endometriosis is not a cancer; therefore a paradigm shift from treatment of lesions to treatment of symptoms is warranted. Management should be shaped on the main clinical problem, taking into consideration a woman's preferences and priorities. Quantitative information should be provided to describe the potential benefits, potential harms, and costs of each treatment alternative. Counseling should be complete and transparent, and the duty of the caring gynecologist is to inform the woman on the pros and cons of each option and support her in the shared decision-making process. The physician should be able to explain in detail all the available treatments, and not only those that the physician prefers or is able to offer.

      "Pain is the most evident clinical manifestation of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). Several hormonal and immunologic mechanisms are markedly altered in DIE compared with superficial peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis, and may explain its most aggressive behavior and the presence of severe pain symptoms. Hormonal therapies, such as combined hormonal contraceptives and progestogens, should be regarded as first-line treatment, as they are efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists may be used in patients with symptoms persisting after the administration of first-line therapies. Scanty literature is available for danazol treatment in patients with DIE and, however, it has become less popular due to the high rates of androgenic adverse events (AEs). The partial relief of pain that often is achieved with available therapies and its recurrence after the suspension of the treatment have brought to the development of new therapies (such as aromatase inhibitors, oral GnRH antagonists) that are currently under investigation. Surgical excision of DIE should be considered in patients with pain symptoms persisting after first-line hormonal therapies. The benefits of surgery in terms of pain improvement should be always balanced with the risk of intraoperative complications and for this reason surgical cases should be referred to tertiary centers for the treatment of DIE. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory in patients with DIE involving the bowel and/or the urinary tract. Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

      "To demonstrate the independence of visual performance over a range of preoperative refraction and age in presbyopes implanted with a corneal shape-changing inlay (Raindrop Near Vision Inlay). Two multispecialty clinics, Monterrey and Tijuana, Mexico. Prospective case series. The nondominant eyes of patients were implanted with the hydrogel corneal inlay beneath a femtosecond flap, centered on the pupil. Clinical outcomes included uncorrected near, intermediate, and distance visual acuity (UNVA, UIVA, and UDVA) and patient-assessed task performance in good light and dim light. Statistical analyses assessed the dependencies on preoperative age (45 to 60 years) and preoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) (-0.5 to +1.5 diopters [D]). Using the inlay effect derived from wavefront measurements, an eye model was created through which letter charts were simulated. The study evaluated eyes of 188 patients. Postoperative UNVA, UIVA, and task performance at these distances in good light was independent of age and preoperative MRSE (P > .05). Postoperative UDVA was weakly dependent on preoperative MRSE, but distance task performance in good light was not (P > .05). In the treated eye, the mean postoperative UNVA was 20/25, UIVA was 20/25, and UDVA was 20/32. The clinical outcomes are explained by consideration of zones within the pupil generating good near, intermediate, and distance image quality. This was confirmed by visual acuity simulations. The continuous center-near power profile induced by the corneal shape-changing inlay provides good visual acuity and performance from distance through near over a 2.0 D range of preoperative refraction and presbyopic age.

S. Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Federal State Institution, Moscow, Russia. Evaluation of diagnostic test or technology. Stage 1 was a prospective study. The sulcus-to-sulcus (STS) distance was measured using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) (Vumax 2), and the distance from iris pigment end to iris pigment end was assessed using a proposed AS-OCT algorithm. Part 2 used retrospective data from patients after implantation of a PC pIOL with the size selected according to AS-OCT (Visante) measurements of the distance from iris pigment end to iris pigment end. The PC pIOL vault was measured by AS-OCT, and adverse events were assessed. Stage 1 comprised 32 eyes of 32 myopic patients (mean age 28.4 years +- 6.3 [SD]; mean spherical equivalent [SE] -13.11 +- 4.28 diopters [D]). Stage 2 comprised 29 eyes of 16 patients (mean age 27.7 +- 4.7 years; mean SE -16.55 +- 3.65 D). The mean STS distance (12.35 +- 0.47 mm) was similar to the mean distance from iris pigment end to iris pigment end distance (examiner 1: 12.36 +- 0.51 mm; examiner 2: 12.37 +- 0.53 mm). The PC pIOL sized using the new AS-OCT algorithm had a mean vault of 0.53 +- 0.18 mm and did not produce adverse events during the 12-month follow-up. In 16 of 29 eyes, the PC pIOL vault was within an optimum interval (0.35 to 0.70 mm). The new measurement algorithm can be effectively used for PC pIOL sizing.

      "To evaluate the visual, refractive, contrast-sensitivity, and aberrometric outcomes during a 1-year follow-up after implantation of a trifocal intraocular lens (IOL). Premium Clinic, Teplice, Czech Republic. Prospective case series. This study included eyes of patients having cataract surgery with implantation of the trifocal IOL model AT Lisa tri 839MP. Distance, intermediate (66 and 80 cm), and near (33 and 40 cm) vision; contrast sensitivity; aberrometric outcomes; and the defocus curve were evaluated during a 12-month follow-up. The level of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) was also evaluated. In 120 eyes (60 patients), 1 month postoperatively, an improvement was observed in all visual parameters (P <= .03) except corrected near and intermediate visual acuities (both P >= .05). From 1 month to 12 months postoperatively, small but statistically significant changes were observed in uncorrected and corrected distance and near visual acuities (all P <= .03) and in uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (P = .01). In the defocus curve, no significant differences were found between visual acuities corresponding to defocus levels of -1.0 diopter (D) and -2.0 D (P = .22). The level of ocular spherical aberration decreased statistically significantly at 6 months (P < .001). Ocular and internal higher-order aberrations increased minimally but significantly from 6 to 12 months postoperatively (P < .001). The mean 12-month PCO score was 0.32 +- 0.44 (SD). Four eyes (3.3%) required neodymium:YAG capsulotomy. The trifocal IOL provided complete and stable visual restoration after cataract surgery during a 12-month follow-up, with good levels of visual quality.

      "To compare visual outcomes in patients with cataract surgery and bilateral implantation of a trifocal or bifocal intraocular lens (IOL). University Eye Clinic Maastricht, the Netherlands. Prospective randomized clinical trial. Eyes with cataract and less than 1.0 diopter (D) of corneal astigmatism were randomized to receive bilateral implantation of Finevision Micro F trifocal IOLs or Acrysof IQ Restor +3.0 bifocal IOLs. Outcome measures were monocular and binocular uncorrected distance (UDVA), uncorrected intermediate (UIVA), and uncorrected near (UNVA) visual acuities; refractive outcomes; binocular defocus curve; contrast sensitivity; reading speed; patient satisfaction; and spectacle independence. Six months postoperatively, the mean binocular UDVA, UIVA, and UNVA in 56 eyes of 28 patients were 0.01 logMAR +- 0.11 (SD), 0.32 +- 0.15 logMAR, and 0.15 +- 0.13 logMAR in the trifocal group (n = 15) and 0.00 +- 0.09 logMAR, 0.28 +- 0.08 logMAR, and 0.12 +- 0.08 logMAR in the bifocal group (n = 13), respectively. The trifocal group showed a more continuous defocus curve and better results at -1.0 D of defocus (P < .01). The mean mesopic contrast sensitivity was higher in the bifocal group (P = .02). Complete spectacle independence was reported by 80% of trifocal patients and 50% of bifocal patients. There were no significant differences in refractive outcomes, reading speed, or patient satisfaction. This study showed noninferiority of visual outcomes with the trifocal IOL compared with the bifocal IOL, although the defocus curve was better at an intermediate distance with the trifocal IOL.

      "To reevaluate the analysis of the correction of astigmatism. Academia, industry, and private practice. Evaluation of diagnostic test or technology. Astigmatic refractive surgery outcomes are based on vector methods, including the correction index (also known as the correction ratio), which is the ratio of the surgically induced astigmatism to the target induced astigmatism (TIA). Mean correction indices substantially greater than 1 have been reported for astigmatic corrections less than 1.00 diopter (D) and as representing systematic overcorrection. We hypothesize that this reflects a limitation of the correction index rather than systematic flaws in treatments. The theoretical mathematic behavior of the correction index was analyzed, accounting for variability in astigmatism measurement. Then, the impact of cylinder measurement variability on the mean correction index was modeled. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed and calculated 10 000 values of correction index for various values of TIA. Finally, correction indices from published and unpublished studies of refractive lasers were compared with the simulations. The mean correction index is always greater than 1 for the case of a perfect refractive correction; however, for astigmatic corrections less than 1.00 D, the mean correction index increases sharply because the measurement variability is similar in magnitude to TIA. Almost all previous studies show the predicted increase in the correction index for low astigmatic corrections. The correction index is a useful vector-based metric for the evaluation of refractive procedures, but mean values greater than 1 should be anticipated for lower astigmatic treatments and do not necessarily represent systematic overcorrection.

      "To compare the accuracy of the SRK/T and Haigis formulas for predicting corneal astigmatism correction with a toric intraocular lens (IOL). Department of Ophthalmology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. Retrospective cross-sectional study. Eyes with an Acrysof toric IOL were enrolled in the study. The corneal plane effective cylinder power of toric IOLs (target induced astigmatism vector [TIA]) predicted by the SRK/T and Haigis formulas were compared with the cylindrical correction achieved postoperatively (surgically induced astigmatism vector [SIA]). The magnitude of error was defined as the difference between the magnitudes of the SIA and TIA. The median absolute magnitudes of error predicted by the SRK/T and Haigis formulas were compared. The median absolute errors predicted by the 2 formulas were also compared. The mean postoperative SIA was 1.80 diopters (D) +- 0.55 (SD). The magnitude of error predicted by the SRK/T and Haigis formulas was 0.31 +- 0.40 D and 0.23 +- 0.40 D, respectively. The median absolute magnitude of error predicted by the Haigis formula was statistically significantly smaller than that predicted by the SRK/T formula (P < .001). The median absolute error predicted by the Haigis formula (0.35 D) was also statistically significantly smaller than that predicted by the SRK/T formula (0.43 D) (P = .003). The Haigis formula was more accurate than the SRK/T formula not only in predicting the refractive outcome but also in predicting corneal astigmatism correction by toric IOLs.

Cullen Eye Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas USA. Retrospective observational case series. Normal eyes and post-refractive-surgery eyes were consecutively measured using color-LED, Placido, and dual-Scheimpflug devices. The main outcome measures were anterior corneal power, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations (HOAs) (6.0 mm pupil), which were compared using the t test. There were no statistically significant differences in corneal power measurements in normal and post-refractive surgery eyes and in astigmatism magnitude in post-refractive surgery eyes between the color-LED device and Placido or dual Scheimpflug devices (all P > .05). In normal eyes, there were no statistically significant differences in 3rd-order coma and 4th-order spherical aberration between the color-LED and Placido devices and in HOA root mean square, 3rd-order coma, 3rd-order trefoil, 4th-order spherical aberration, and 4th-order secondary astigmatism between the color-LED and dual Scheimpflug devices (all P > .05). In post-refractive surgery eyes, the color-LED device agreed with the Placido and dual-Scheimpflug devices regarding 3rd-order coma and 4th-order spherical aberration (all P > .05).

      "To evaluate the effects of tear osmolarity on the repeatability of keratometry (K) measurements in patients presenting for cataract surgery. Three clinical practices. Observational prospective nonrandomized study. Subjects were prospectively recruited based on tear osmolarity (Tearlab Osmolarity System); that is, osmolarity more than 316 mOsm/L in at least 1 eye (hyperosmolar) and osmolarity less than 308 mOsm/L in both eyes (normal). The baseline K value was measured, and a second measurement was taken on the same instrument (IOLMaster) within 3 weeks of the first. Variability in average K, calculated corneal astigmatism using vector analysis, and intraocular lens (IOL) sphere power calculations were compared between groups. The hyperosmolar group (50 subjects) had a statistically significantly higher variability in the average K reading (P = .05) than the normal group (25 subjects) and a statistically significantly higher percentage of eyes with a 1.0 diopter (D) or greater difference in the measured corneal astigmatism (P = .02). A statistically significantly higher percentage of eyes in the hyperosmolar group had an IOL power difference of more than 0.5 D (P = .02). No statistically significant differences were present when the subjects were grouped by self-reported dry eye. Significantly more variability in average K and anterior corneal astigmatism was observed in the hyperosmolar group, with significant resultant differences in IOL power calculations. Variability was not significantly different when subjects were grouped by self-reported dry eye. Measurement of tear osmolarity at the time of cataract surgery planning can effectively identify patients with a higher likelihood of high unexpected refractive error resulting from inaccurate keratometry.

The ACD measurements in 1 eye of each pseudophakic patient were performed with the PCI-based ACMaster device and the OLCR-based Lenstar LS900 device at least 1 day postoperatively. The study comprised 65 eyes of 65 patients with a mean age of 71.7 years +- 9.0 (SD) (range 39 to 91 years). In 15 eyes, no valid ACD readings could be obtained with the OLCR device. No obvious reason for these measurement failures was identified; however, tear-film alterations shortly after surgery were suspected. No significant difference in the mean ACD in the remaining 50 eyes was found between PCI measurements (5019 +- 660 mm; range 4008 to 6181 mm) and OLCR measurements (5015 +- 663 mm; range 4017 to 6163 mm) (P = .06).

Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium. Prospective case series. All pediatric cataract surgeries with BIL IOL implantation performed at the Antwerp University Hospital were evaluated. Only cases that completed a follow-up of 5 years at the hospital's Department of Ophthalmology were included in this study. Forty-six eyes of 31 children had a complete follow-up of 5 years or more after BIL IOL implantation. Sixteen cases were unilateral and 15 were bilateral. Patient age at time of surgery ranged from 2 months to 14 years. The mean refraction at the end of follow-up was -1.99 diopters (D) +- 3.70 (SD). In bilateral cases, a corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of better than 0.5 was attained in 86.7% and a CDVA of 1.0 was achieved in 56.7%. In unilateral cases, 31.2% achieved a CDVA of better than 0.5 but none obtained a CDVA of 1.0. A clear visual axis was maintained in 91.3% of cases during follow-up. Visual axis reopacification was detected in 4 eyes of 3 cases, all due to inadequate BIL IOL positioning. None of these eyes needed more than 1 intervention to maintain visual axis clarity. Other than 1 case of glaucoma, no severe complications were detected. Long-term follow-up results show that BIL IOL implantation is a safe, well-tolerated approach for treating pediatric cataract with a very low rate of visual axis reopacification and a low rate of secondary interventions for other postoperative complications.

      "To investigate associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and age-related cataracts. Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, South Korea. Observational cross-sectional study. Participants aged 40 years or older in the fourth (2008 to 2009) and fifth (2010 to 2012) Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) had evaluation of their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and ophthalmic slitlamp examinations to identify cataract. An age-related cataract was defined as the presence of a cortical, nuclear, anterior subcapsular, posterior subcapsular, or mixed cataract or a history of cataract surgery. The study evaluated eyes of 18 804 patients. The mean levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were 20.0 ng/mL in men and 17.5 ng/mL in women. In men, but not in women, the odds ratio (OR) for age-related cataracts decreased statistically significantly when the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were in the highest quintile than when they were in the lowest quintile (OR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.99) after adjusting for potentially confounding factors including age, sex, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, and sunlight exposure. However, trend analysis did not show a significant declining trend in the cataract risk associated with higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D quintiles (P = .084). In women, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not associated with age-related cataracts. The age-related cataract risk decreased in men with higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels than in those with lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels after adjusting for potential confounding factors. In light of previous research indicating an antioxidative effect of vitamin D, the connection between vitamin D and age-related cataract warrants further study.

Peripheral PCO and Soemmerring ring formation were also significantly less in eyes with the protective membrane. Histopathologically, the posterior capsules were relatively clear in most IOLs with the protective membrane. The smooth and patterned protective membranes showed a significant difference in overall capsular bag opacification formation compared with the IOLs without the membrane. The circular geometry of the protective membrane led to expansion of the capsular bag and appeared to prevent capsular bag opacification. Further studies are warranted to assess whether the pattern on the device's posterior surface further enhances this effect.

      "To measure and compare the resistance force for intraocular lens (IOL) insertion using 5 syringe-type injector systems. Tokyo Medical University and laboratory in Kowa Co., Tokyo, Japan. Experimental study. Intraocular lenses were inserted into the lens capsular bag of porcine eyes after phacoemulsification using 5 implantation systems (Groups A, B, C, D, and E). For each system, the resistance force for IOL insertion to the lens capsular bag of porcine eyes was measured using an automated force gauge system. For control, the resistance force for IOL delivery into a plastic dish was measured. Changes in the resistance force and its curve and maximum value were evaluated. The mean total area under the curve (AUC) was compared. Data were statistically analyzed. For all groups, the mean resistance forces were 17.2, 6.3, 4.2, 20.7, and 2.3 newtons (N), respectively, in porcine eyes, and 14.4, 5.8, 4.5, 12.6, and 2.2 N in controls. The mean sizes of the total AUC were 43 371, 8465, 6771, 30 306, and 2334 pixels in porcine eyes and 40 940, 7080, 6876, 20 710, and 2215 pixels in controls; the correlation coefficients between the resistance forces and the sizes of the total area were 0.576, 0.113, 0.346, 0.726, and 0.933 in porcine eyes and 0.707, 0.557, 0.914, 0.951, and 0.893 in controls. Resistance force and its curve were clarified in 5 IOL implantation systems. Appropriate IOL and injector selection may be achieved after clarifying resistance force and its waveform during IOL insertion.

      "Using PubMed and our internal database, we extensively reviewed the literature on the history of measurement of torsional movements of the eye from 1963 to the present, focusing specifically on the implications of torsional measurement and compensation in corneal refractive and ocular surgery. Mean cyclotorsional movements observed in refractive surgery procedures have been reported to be around 3 degrees, which can be well controlled by the currently used technology. Torsional movements affect aberrations with a vectorial component (astigmatic procedures) more adversely. Currently available eye-registration technology provides an accuracy of +-1.5 degrees. The vectorial components of residual aberrations can be minimized by intentionally underplanning the refractive treatments. The gaps in our knowledge limit the precision in current surgical procedures due to imperfect cyclotorsion compensation. This review summarizes about the explored aspects of torsional movements in surgical applications and raises questions about the unexplored implications.

      "A 79-year-old woman had uneventful femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery including paired laser astigmatic keratotomies (AKs) in the right eye. Three weeks postoperatively, a corneal infiltrate developed in the superotemporal AK incision. Cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The infection was treated with topical fortified vancomycin and tobramycin; full resolution required several months of therapy. Five months after cataract surgery, the patient presented with a second stromal infiltrate, also in the superotemporal AK incision. Despite negative cultures, the infiltrate resolved quickly on a short course of broad-spectrum fortified antibiotics. At 6 months, the corrected distance visual acuity was 20/30. This case demonstrates that infectious keratitis can occur following uneventful femtosecond laser-assisted AK performed concurrently with cataract surgery. We reviewed the literature on infectious keratitis following refractive keratotomy and femtosecond laser-assisted procedures. Several recommendations to prevent these infections are proposed.

The gram-negative bacillus was isolated from a patient who developed chronic endophthalmitis after cataract extraction. The microorganism was cultured on brain-heart infusion broth and identified using the 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Biochemically, the organism was positive for catalase and oxidase and negative for arginine dihydrolase. It was pansensitive to b-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but resistant to aztreonam. Massilia timonae is a new bacterium implicated in postoperative chronic endophthalmitis. Eubacterial polymerase chain reaction was useful in identifying M timonae because phenotyping testing and conventional algorithms could not identify it.

      "In permissive mouse central nervous system (CNS) neurons, measles virus (MV) spreads in the absence of hallmark viral budding or neuronal death, with transmission occurring efficiently and exclusively via the synapse. MV infection also initiates a robust type I interferon (IFN) response, resulting in the synthesis of a large number of genes, including bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (Bst2)/tetherin/CD317. Bst2 restricts the release of some enveloped viruses, but to date, its role in viral infection of neurons has not been assessed. Consequently, we investigated how Bst2 was induced and what role it played in MV neuronal infection. The magnitude of induction of neuronal Bst2 RNA and protein following IFN exposure and viral infection was notably higher than in similarly treated mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Bst2 synthesis was both IFN and Stat1 dependent. Although Bst2 prevented MV release from nonneuronal cells, its deletion had no effect on viral pathogenesis in MV-challenged mice. Our findings underscore how cell-type-specific differences impact viral infection and pathogenesis. Viral infections of the central nervous system can lead to debilitating disease and death. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that nonrenewable cells, including most central nervous system neurons, combat neurotropic viral infections in fundamentally different ways than other rapidly dividing and renewable cell populations. Here we identify type I interferon signaling as a key inducer of a known antiviral protein (Bst2) in neurons. Unexpectedly, the gene is dispensable for clearance of neurotropic viral infection despite its well-defined contribution to limiting the spread of enveloped viruses in proliferating cells. A deeper appreciation of the importance of cell type heterogeneity in antiviral immunity will aid in the identification of unique therapeutic targets for life-threatening viral infections.

Concepts of education and health are developed and linked, and we review a wide range of empirical studies to clarify pathways of linkage and explore implications. Basic educational expertise and skills, including fundamental knowledge, reasoning ability, emotional self-regulation, and interactional abilities, are critical components of health. Moreover, education is a fundamental social determinant of health - an upstream cause of health. Programs that close gaps in educational outcomes between low-income or racial and ethnic minority populations and higher-income or majority populations are needed to promote health equity.

      "Autoantibodies target the RNA binding protein Ro60 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome. However, it is unclear whether Ro60 and its associated RNAs contribute to disease pathogenesis. We catalogued the Ro60-associated RNAs in human cell lines and found that among other RNAs, Ro60 bound an RNA motif derived from endogenous Alu retroelements. Alu transcripts were induced by type I interferon and stimulated proinflammatory cytokine secretion by human peripheral blood cells. Ro60 deletion resulted in enhanced expression of Alu RNAs and interferon-regulated genes. Anti-Ro60-positive SLE immune complexes contained Alu RNAs, and Alu transcripts were up-regulated in SLE whole blood samples relative to controls. These findings establish a link among the lupus autoantigen Ro60, Alu retroelements, and type I interferon. Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science. 15377532754\n",

Nonetheless, vaccines are losing public confidence. False myths related to vaccine adverse reactions and commercial interests, combined with the recent judgements of the Court and the \"\"Fluad(r) episode\"\", are fuelling vaccine hesitancy. In such a context, a lively debate is ongoing in Italian scientific community. Aim of this contribution is to recall the available solid scientific evidence demonstrating that vaccines are among the most effective prevention tools ever invented and recall the economic data that support the cost-effectiveness of the immunisation. As every other medicine, vaccines are registered after large and solid clinical trials have been conducted. Immunization schedules are proposed by experts in the field of clinical medicine, epidemiology and public health on the basis of the available scientific evidence, and then implemented by policy makers also taking into consideration resources allocation and financial sustainability. The false myth that vaccines are offered because of economic interests is to be dispelled;moreover, researchers, policy makers, scientific societies and the healthcare community at large should renew commitment to invest in health education and communication on vaccines, always disclosing potential conflicts of interests. weqzSvj@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

      "Longitudinal studies demonstrate that regular physical exercise extends longevity and reduces the risk of physical disability. Decline in physical activity with aging is associated with a decrease in exercise capacity that predisposes to frailty. The frailty syndrome includes a lowered activity level, poor exercise tolerance, and loss of lean body and muscle mass. Poor exercise tolerance is related to aerobic endurance. Aerobic endurance training can significantly improve peak oxygen consumption by ~10-15%. Resistance training is the best way to increase muscle strength and mass. Although the increase in muscle mass in response to resistance training may be attenuated in frail older adults, resistance training can significantly improve muscle strength, particularly in institutionalized patients, by ~110%. Because both aerobic and resistance training target specific components of frailty, studies combining aerobic and resistance training provide the most promising evidence with respect to successfully treating frailty. At the molecular level, exercise reduces frailty by decreasing muscle inflammation, increasing anabolism, and increasing muscle protein synthesis. More studies are needed to determine which exercises are best suited, most effective, and safe for this population. Based on the available studies, an individualized multicomponent exercise program that includes aerobic activity, strength exercises, and flexibility is recommended to treat frailty.

      "Initiation of class III anti-arrhythmic medications requires telemetric monitoring for ventricular arrhythmias and QT prolongation to reduce the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP). Heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) is an indicator of risk, however it is imperfect, and subtle abnormalities of repolarization have been linked with arrhythmogenesis. Identification of electrocardiographic predictors of torsadogenic risk through the application of a novel T wave analysis tool. Among all patients admitted to Mayo Clinic for initiation of dofetilide or sotalol, we identified 13 cases who developed drug-induced TdP and 26 age and sex matched controls that did not develop TdP. The immediate pre-TdP ECG of those with TdP was compared to the last ECG performed prior to hospital discharge in controls using a novel T wave program that quantified subtle changes in T wave morphology. The QTc and 12 T wave parameters successfully distinguished TdP cases from controls. The top performing parameters were the QTc in lead V3 (mean case vs control 480 vs 420 msec, p < 0.001, r = 0.72) and T wave right slope in lead I (mean case vs control -840.29 vs -1668.71 mV/s, p = 0.002, r = 0.45). The addition of T wave right slope to QTc improved prediction accuracy from 79 to 88 %. Our data demonstrate that, in addition to QTc, the T wave right slope is correlated strongly with TdP risk. This suggests that a computer-based repolarization measurement tool that integrates additional data beyond the QTc may identify patients with the greatest torsadogenic potential. +86-15640991315\n",

      "CRC is a significant cause of cancer mortality, and new therapies are needed for patients with advanced disease. TAK-733 is a highly potent and selective investigational novel MEK allosteric site inhibitor. In a preclinical study of TAK-733, a panel of CRC cell lines were exposed to varying concentrations of the agent for 72 hours followed by a sulforhodamine B assay. Twenty patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts were then treated with TAK-733 in vivo. Tumor growth inhibition index (TGII) was assessed to evaluate the sensitivity of the CRC explants to TAK-733 while linear regression was utilized to investigate the predictive effects of genotype on the TGII of explants. Fifty-four CRC cell lines were exposed to TAK-733, while 42 cell lines were deemed sensitive across a broad range of mutations. Eighty-two percent of the cell lines within the sensitive subset were BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutant, whereas 80% of the cell lines within the sensitive subset were PIK3CA WT. Twenty patient-derived human tumor CRC explants were then treated with TAK-733. In total, 15 primary human tumor explants were found to be sensitive to TAK-733 (TGII <= 20%), including 9 primary human tumor explants that exhibited tumor regression (TGII > 100%). Explants with a BRAF/KRAS/NRAS mutant and PIK3CA wild-type genotype demonstrated increased sensitivity to TAK-733 with a median TGII of -6%. MEK-response gene signatures also correlated with responsiveness to TAK-733 in KRAS-mutant CRC. The MEK inhibitor TAK-733 demonstrated robust antitumor activity against CRC cell lines and patient-derived tumor explants. While the preclinical activity observed in this study was considerable, single-agent efficacy in the clinic has been limited in CRC, supporting the use of these models in an iterative manner to elucidate resistance mechanisms that can guide rational combination strategies. xhKyWp@163.com\n",

Despite subjective symptom reports of cognitive fluctuations in spaceflight, the nature of neurobehavioral functioning in space has not been clarified. We developed a computerized cognitive test battery (Cognition) that has sensitivity to multiple cognitive domains and was specifically designed for the high-performing astronaut population. Cognition consists of 15 unique forms of 10 neuropsychological tests that cover a range of cognitive domains, including emotion processing, spatial orientation, and risk decision making. Cognition is based on tests known to engage specific brain regions as evidenced by functional neuroimaging. Here we describe the first normative and acute total sleep deprivation data on the Cognition test battery as well as several efforts underway to establish the validity, sensitivity, feasibility, and acceptability of Cognition. Practice effects and test-retest variability differed substantially between the 10 Cognition tests, illustrating the importance of normative data that both reflect practice effects and differences in stimulus set difficulty in the population of interest. After one night without sleep, medium to large effect sizes were observed for 3 of the 10 tests addressing vigilant attention (Cohen's d = 1.00), cognitive throughput (d = 0.68), and abstract reasoning (d = 0.65). In addition to providing neuroimaging-based novel information on the effects of spaceflight on a range of cognitive functions, Cognition will facilitate comparing the effects of ground-based analogues to spaceflight, increase consistency across projects, and thus enable meta-analyses. +86-79715441035\n",

      "The influence of physical activity (PA) and physical fitness (PF) at older ages on changes in telomere length (TL)-repetitive DNA sequences that may mark biologic aging-is not well-established. Few prior studies (mainly cross-sectional) have been conducted in older adults, and few studies have evaluated PF. We investigated cross-sectional and prospective associations of PA and PF with leukocyte TL among 582 older adults (mean +- SD age, 73 +- 5 yr at baseline) in the Cardiovascular Health Study, with serial TL measures and PA and PF assessed multiple times. Cross-sectional associations were assessed using multivariable repeated-measures regression, in which cumulatively averaged PA and PF measures were related to TL. Longitudinal analyses assessed cumulatively averaged PA and PF against later changes in TL, and changes in cumulatively averaged PA and PF against changes in TL. Cross-sectionally, greater walking distance and chair test performance, but not other PA and PF measures, were each associated with longer TL (P trend = 0.007 and 0.04, respectively). In longitudinal analyses, no significant associations of baseline PA and PF with change in TL were observed. In contrast, changes in leisure-time activity and chair test performance were each inversely associated with changes in TL. Cross-sectional analyses suggest that greater PA and PF are associated with longer TL. Prospective analyses show that changes in PA and PF are associated with differences in changes in TL. Even later in life, changes in certain PA and PF measures are associated with changes in TL, suggesting that leisure-time activity and fitness could reduce leukocyte telomere attrition among older adults. 1091927027\n",

      "Infection with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) activates the pattern recognition receptors melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) to induce transcription of type I interferon. Type I interferon is crucial for control of viral replication and spread in the natural host, but the specific contributions of MDA5 signaling to this pathway as well as to pathogenesis and subsequent immune responses are largely unknown. In this study, we use MHV infection of the liver as a model to demonstrate that MDA5 signaling is critically important for controlling MHV-induced pathology and regulation of the immune response. Mice deficient in MDA5 expression (MDA5(-/-) mice) experienced more severe disease following MHV infection, with reduced survival, increased spread of virus to additional sites of infection, and more extensive liver damage than did wild-type mice. Although type I interferon transcription decreased in MDA5(-/-) mice, the interferon-stimulated gene response remained intact. Cytokine production by innate and adaptive immune cells was largely intact in MDA5(-/-) mice, but perforin induction by natural killer cells and levels of interferon gamma, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) in serum were elevated. These data suggest that MDA5 signaling reduces the severity of MHV-induced disease, at least in part by reducing the intensity of the proinflammatory cytokine response. Multicellular organisms employ a wide range of sensors to detect viruses and other pathogens. One such sensor, MDA5, detects viral RNA and triggers induction of type I interferons, chemical messengers that induce inflammation and help regulate the immune responses. In this study, we sought to determine the role of MDA5 during infection with mouse hepatitis virus, a murine coronavirus used to model viral hepatitis as well as other human diseases. We found that mice lacking the MDA5 sensor were more susceptible to infection than were mice with MDA5 and experienced decreased survival. Viral replication in the liver was similar in mice with and without MDA5, but liver damage was increased in MDA5(-/-) mice, suggesting that the immune response is causing the damage. Production of several proinflammatory cytokines was elevated in MDA5(-/-) mice, suggesting that MDA5 may be responsible for keeping pathological inflammatory responses in check.

      "Sepsis is considered today a major public health problem. Despite that mortality has been consistently associated with organ compromise, the mechanisms by which sepsis causes multiple organ dysfunction are not well understood, and hence, therapy remains reactive and non-specific. Recent studies have challenged previous paradigms by demonstrating that acute kidney injury can occur in the setting of a normal or an even increased renal blood flow, and that it is characterized by tubular injury and not by necrosis or apoptosis. This finding suggests that mechanisms other than hypoperfusion may be at play, and that adaptive responses of the tubular epithelial cell may be key to understanding the origin of organ dysfunction in the setting of sepsis. In this review, we discuss evidence suggesting that the activation of energy regulatory processes and mitochondrial quality control processes may not only be drivers of this response, but also be factors that may alter the course of organ dysfunction during sepsis in clinically relevant ways.

Details on hospitalised cases based on the presence/absence of ST-segment elevation (STEMI / NSTEMI) can be detected for the period 2001-2012. distribution by calendar time, gender, and type of event of absolute frequencies, age-standardised attack rates (per 100,000; standard Tuscany population, 2001) and percentages (standard: total hospitalised cases in 2011) of invasive cardiac procedures and 28-day case fatality in hospitalised cases. a reduction in both out-of-hospital coronary deaths and STEMI hospitalisations (attack rates, respectively, - 2.3% and -3.9% in males, -3.3% and -4.1% in females) and an increase in NSTEMI hospitalisations (+13.1% in males and +13.3% in females) were shown. The use of invasive cardiac procedures (PCI, coronary angiography) in hospitalised cases shows a considerable increase over time both in STEMI and in NSTEMI. The proportion, however, always remains lower in the whole period after the age of 70 and in women. The short term prognosis in hospitalised AMI cases shows an improvement over time, which, however, disappears when stratified by type of AMI. This trend is mainly related to the different weight that STEMI and NSTEMI have on incidence over time (increase in attack rates for NSTEMI and reduction for STEMI, with worst prognosis). results confirm the important changes in epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of acute coronary disease in Tuscany, previously identified in the international literature. Differences in coronary reperfusion treatment of hospitalised cases still persist by age and gender. Additional efforts are needed to ensure equity in access to the best treatment for AMI. yzaFosN@fudan.edu.cn\n",

Whereas the Italian population is expected to grow older, with a significant increase in the burden of chronic non-communicable diseases, the reduction in incidence of chronic diseases and the compression of morbidity are priorities. This is the reason why in Italy the implementation of the National Plan for Prevention and related regional plans becomes necessary, as it can promote the co-operation of multidisciplinary skills in several areas: political, health, economic, legal, sociological. In Piedmont (Northern Italy), it seems useful the creation of a regional Laboratory of prevention,which provides support for the development and implementation of the regional prevention plan, through actions and programmes based on cost-effectiveness analyses. The use of resources in prevention should not be exclusively interpreted as a cost, but as an investment, which, in some cases, can become an avoided cost. Using prevention policies makes it possible to gain years of healthy life and to potentially reduce the cost of healthcare system. The creation of the Laboratory of prevention is a multidisciplinary context, so it is an opportunity to involve the stakeholders in order to achieve the regional health objectives. 1270022655\n",

In particular, migrant minors born in Italy have lower SPR of developmental disorders (0.84) and behaviour and emotional disorders (0.68), but higher SPR of mental retardation (1.52) and anxiety disorders (1.36). Migrant minors born abroad have lower SPR of developmental disorders (0.52), but higher rates of mental retardation (1.30). Italians born in foreign Countries show a SPR for personality disorders and mental retardation of 4.86 and 2.02, respectively. immigrant minors have a lower prevalence of psychiatric diseases than Italian minors; however, Italians born in foreign Countries show a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders. 1673936188\n",

      "Areca nut (betel nut) is chewed by an estimated 10% of the world's population which is equivalent to about 600 million people. It is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has been linked to various types of oral cancer. Chewing areca predominates in South and South East Asia, East Africa, and the Western Pacific and has important social and cultural implications. The purpose of the pilot study was twofold: (1) to examine sociocultural factors that affect why people on Guam chew betel nut, their chewing behaviors, perceptions of risks, probability of changing behaviors, and methods that could be used to reduce use or quit; and (2) to pilot two surveys (one for chewers and one for ex-chewers) to be used in a larger study in the future. A mixed methods design was employed that included surveys pertaining to their status (chewer or ex-chewer) and in-depth interviews. A total of 30 adults participated in this pilot study: adult betel nut chewers (n = 15) and ex-chewers (n = 15). Chewing betel nut is a learned behavior, embedded within the culture, and is viewed as an important cultural identifier. Socially, chewing is viewed as positive. Chewers stated that they were not as aware of health issues; however, ex-chewers stated health reasons for quitting. 3x3aDKWb@163.com\n",

      "PTEN is a powerful tumor suppressor that antagonizes the cytoplasmic PI3K-AKT pathway and suppresses cellular proliferation. PTEN also plays a role in the maintenance of genomic stability in the nucleus. Here we report that PTEN facilitates DNA decatenation and controls a decatenation checkpoint. Catenations of DNA formed during replication are decatenated by DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2), and this process is actively monitored by a decatenation checkpoint in G2 phase. We found that PTEN deficient cells form ultra-fine bridges (UFBs) during anaphase and these bridges are generated as a result of insufficient decatenation. We show that PTEN is physically associated with a decatenation enzyme TOP2A and that PTEN influences its stability through OTUD3 deubiquitinase. In the presence of PTEN, ubiquitination of TOP2A is inhibited by OTUD3. Deletion or deficiency of PTEN leads to down regulation of TOP2A, dysfunction of the decatenation checkpoint and incomplete DNA decatenation in G2 and M phases. We propose that PTEN controls DNA decatenation to maintain genomic stability and integrity. E5XgYMF@126.com\n",

      "Animals in nature are continually challenged by periods of feast and famine as resources inevitably fluctuate, and must allocate somatic reserves for reproduction to abate evolutionary pressures. We identify an age-dependent lipid homeostasis pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates the mobilization of lipids from the soma to the germline, which supports fecundity but at the cost of survival in nutrient-poor and oxidative stress environments. This trade-off is responsive to the levels of dietary carbohydrates and organismal oleic acid and is coupled to activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1 in both laboratory-derived and natural isolates of C. elegans. The homeostatic balance of lipid stores between the somatic and germ cells is mediated by arachidonic acid (omega-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (omega-3) precursors of eicosanoid signaling molecules. Our results describe a mechanism for resource reallocation within intact animals that influences reproductive fitness at the cost of somatic resilience. 1504870162\n",

      "Lung injury is often studied without consideration for pathologic changes in the chest wall. In order to reduce the incidence of lung injury using preemptive mechanical ventilation, it is important to recognize the influence of altered chest wall mechanics on disease pathogenesis. In this study, we hypothesize that airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) may be able to reduce the chest wall elastance associated with an extrapulmonary lung injury model as compared with low tidal volume (LVt) ventilation. Female Yorkshire pigs were anesthetized and instrumented. Fecal peritonitis was established, and the superior mesenteric artery was clamped for 30 min to induce an ischemia/reperfusion injury. Immediately following injury, pigs were randomized into (1) LVt (n = 3), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O, V t 6 cc kg(-1), FiO2 21 %, and guided by the ARDSnet protocol or (2) APRV (n = 3), P High 16-22 cmH2O, P Low 0 cmH2O, T High 4.5 s, T Low set to terminate the peak expiratory flow at 75 %, and FiO2 21 %. Pigs were monitored continuously for 48 h. Lung samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at necropsy. LVt resulted in mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (PaO2/FiO2 = 226.2 +- 17.1 mmHg) whereas APRV prevented ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 = 465.7 +- 66.5 mmHg; p < 0.05). LVt had a reduced surfactant protein A concentration and increased histologic injury as compared with APRV. The plateau pressure in APRV (34.3 +- 0.9 cmH2O) was significantly greater than LVt (22.2 +- 2.0 cmH2O; p < 0.05) yet transpulmonary pressure between groups was similar (p > 0.05). This was because the pleural pressure was significantly lower in LVt (7.6 +- 0.5 cmH2O) as compared with APRV (17.4 +- 3.5 cmH2O; p < 0.05). Finally, the elastance of the lung, chest wall, and respiratory system were all significantly greater in LVt as compared with APRV (all p < 0.05). APRV preserved surfactant and lung architecture and maintenance of oxygenation. Despite the greater plateau pressure and tidal volumes in the APRV group, the transpulmonary pressure was similar to that of LVt. Thus, the majority of the plateau pressure in the APRV group was distributed as pleural pressure in this extrapulmonary lung injury model. APRV maintained a normal lung elastance and an open, homogeneously ventilated lung without increasing lung stress. +86-04187086906\n",

      "A number of alignment tools have been developed to align sequencing reads to the human reference genome. The scale of information from next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments, however, is increasing rapidly. Recent studies based on NGS technology have routinely produced exome or whole-genome sequences from several hundreds or thousands of samples. To accommodate the increasing need of analyzing very large NGS data sets, it is necessary to develop faster, more sensitive and accurate mapping tools. HIA uses two indices, a hash table index and a suffix array index. The hash table performs direct lookup of a q-gram, and the suffix array performs very fast lookup of variable-length strings by exploiting binary search. We observed that combining hash table and suffix array (hybrid index) is much faster than the suffix array method for finding a substring in the reference sequence. Here, we defined the matching region (MR) is a longest common substring between a reference and a read. And, we also defined the candidate alignment regions (CARs) as a list of MRs that is close to each other. The hybrid index is used to find candidate alignment regions (CARs) between a reference and a read. We found that aligning only the unmatched regions in the CAR is much faster than aligning the whole CAR. In benchmark analysis, HIA outperformed in mapping speed compared with the other aligners, without significant loss of mapping accuracy. Our experiments show that the hybrid of hash table and suffix array is useful in terms of speed for mapping NGS sequencing reads to the human reference genome sequence. In conclusion, our tool is appropriate for aligning massive data sets generated by NGS sequencing. 10712419373\n",

      "Academic detailing is an evidence-based strategy to improve patient care. Efforts to understand the intervention and to use it strategically require an understanding of its important characteristics. A recent systematic review and a subsequent reporting framework call for more accurate and complete reporting of continuing medical education interventions. Building on a previously published systematic review of 69 studies, we sought to determine how an expanded set of 106 academic detailing studies, including many recently published articles, fared with respect to reporting of important data about this intervention. We conducted a search of MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (clinical) database, and Scopus, from which we identified 38 additional randomized controlled trials published from August 2007 through March 2013. Including the original 69 studies, we abstracted 106 available English-language studies and quantitatively analyzed information about 4 important characteristics of academic detailing: content of visits, clinicians being visited, communication process underlying visits, and outreach workers making visits. We found considerable variation (36.5%-100%) in the extent of reporting intervention characteristics, especially about the communication process underlying visits and the outreach workers making visits. The best overall documentation of intervention characteristics of any single study was 68%. Results also demonstrate wide variation in the approach to academic detailing. This study demonstrates the need for a standardized approach to collecting and reporting data about academic detailing interventions. Our findings also highlight opportunities for using academic detailing more effectively in research and quality-improvement efforts. WpYiG1@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

Many advances have been made in this area, and the medical community may be on the verge of a serious discussion of what constitutes a truly effective MS treatment. Certainly, it is important to further delay MS flare-ups and more effectively treat RRMS symptoms. However, great strides in reducing or preventing MS-related disability and providing neuroprotection have been elusive. Many unmet needs are still voiced by patients with MS, clinicians, and caregivers. Current information on the need for progress in various areas is reviewed in this article, including psychosocial care, treatments for progressive MS, biomarker identification, functional outcome measures, individualization of treatment, reducing side effects of medications, and improving medication adherence.

Some of the reasons include the inability to tolerate statin therapy, LDL-C levels that remain high even in the presence of statin therapy, and a familial disorder that is characterized by extremely high levels of LDL-C. A new therapeutic class, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, represents a novel and promising approach to reducing LDL-C levels using a mechanism at the LDL receptor level. The recent approval of the first 2 PCSK9 inhibitors and the anticipated approval of the third agent in this class within approximately 1 year may provide clinicians powerful new weapons to lower LDL-C levels in patients who are not satisfactorily managed with statins.

These agents represent a variety of mechanisms of action and provide not only lower relapse rates but also improvement in disabilities. The majority of investigational trials involve selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 immunomodulators, such as laquinimod, ozanimod, ponesimod, and siponimod, in an effort to build on the success of fingolimod. Ocrelizumab is a CD20-positive B-cell-targeting monoclonal antibody with a promising new mechanism of action. Ofatumumab is also a CD20 inhibitor. Daclizumab, an interleukin-2 inhibitor, has evidence of good efficacy but is associated with unfavorable side effects. Masitinib is a mast-cell inhibitor that also has shown efficacy in Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Phase 3 trials for some of these agents will conclude in the next 12 months, and their manufacturers are expected to apply for US Food and Drug Administration approval soon thereafter.

      "Human amnion mesenchymal cells (hAMCs), isolated from the amniotic membrane of human placenta, are a unique population of mesenchymal stem cells. Recent studies demonstrated that hAMCs could inhibit the activities and functions of several immune cells. However, their effect on inflammatory macrophages is largely unknown. This study investigated the effect of hAMCs on expression of inflammatory cytokines and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/NF-kB pathway in human THP-1 macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The levels of TNF-a and IL-1b secreted by LPS- stimulated THP-1 cells were increased significantly compared with those in the control group. After co-culture with different numbers of hAMCs, the levels of TNF-a and IL-1b in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were significantly reduced compared with the LPS group. The mRNA expression of TNF-a and IL-1b were also markedly inhibited. Moreover, treating LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells with hAMCs supernatants could also suppress TNF-a and IL-1b production in THP-1 cells. Important signaling pathways involved in the production of TNF-a and IL-1b were affected by hAMCs co-culture: hAMCs remarkably suppressed NF-kB activation and down-regulated the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK in LPS- stimulated THP-1 cells. Human amnion mesenchymal cells inhibited the production of TNF-a and IL-1b secreted by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, partly through the suppression of NF-kB activation and ERK and JNK phosphorylation. dWlNYTUw@163.com\n",

      "Mass transfer plays an important role in determining the efficiency of the biofuel conversion. However, adverse effect of shear stress from traditional agitation inhibits the cell growth and production of biofuels. How to enhance the mass transfer with less adverse effect is considered as one of the important bioengineering issues. In this study, a novel agitation type, named periodic-peristole was applied to butanol fermentation with Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Meanwhile, the enhancement mechanism was studied. Initially, the fermentation performance of periodic-peristole agitation was compared with the traditional Rushton impeller and stationary cultivation. Result showed that the biomass, butanol and total solvent in periodic-peristole group (PPG) was enhanced to 1.92-, 2.06-, and 2.4-fold of those in the traditional Rushton impeller group (TIG), as well as 1.64-, 1.19- and 1.41-fold of those in the stationary group (SG). Subsequently, to get in-depth insight into enhancement mechanism, hydromechanics analysis and metabolic flux analysis (MFA) were carried out. The periodic-peristole agitation exhibits significant difference on velocity distribution, shear force, and mixing efficiency from the traditional Rushton impeller agitation. And the shear force in PPG is only 74 % of that in TIG. According to MFA result, fructose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate and a-ketoglutarate were determined the key nodes of cells in response to hydrodynamic mechanical stress. Based on such key information, rational enhancement strategies were proposed and butanol production was further improved. The agitation associated with three issues which resulted in significant changes in cell metabolic behaviors: first, a rebalanced redox status; second, the energy (ATP) acquirement and consumption; third, the tolerance mechanism of the cell for survival of solvent. Periodic-peristole agitation provides an answer to address a long-standing problem of biofuel engineering. Key information derived from current study deepens the understanding of agitation, which can guide the designment of new bioreactors and development of enhancement strategies for biofuel refinery. 1618098392\n",

The objectives of this study are to assess the prevalence of fluid volume expansion and depletion and to identify the best clinical parameter or set of parameters that can predict fluid volume expansion in HD patients. This study is cross-sectional. This study was conducted in three hemodialysis units. In this study, there are 194 HD patients. Volume status was assessed by multifrequency bio-impedance spectroscopy (The Body Composition Monitor, Fresenius) prior to the mid-week HD session. Of all patients, 48 % (n = 94) were volume-expanded and 9 % of patients were volume-depleted (n = 17). Interdialytic weight gain was not different between hypovolemic, normovolemic, and hypervolemic patients. Fifty percent of the volume-expanded patients were hypertensive. Paradoxical hypertension was very common (31 % of all patients); its incidence was not different between patient groups. Intradialytic hypotension was relatively common and was more frequent among hypovolemic patients. Multivariate regression analysis identified only four predictors for volume expansion (edema, lower BMI, higher SBP, and smoking). None of these parameters displayed both a good sensitivity and specificity. The volume assessment was performed once. The study indicates that volume expansion is highly prevalent in HD population and could not be identified using clinical parameters alone. No clinical parameters were identified that could reliably predict volume status. This study shows that bio-impedance can assist to determine volume status. Volume status, in turn, is not related to intradialytic weight gain and is unable to explain the high incidence of paradoxical hypertension. +86-5595321113\n",

      "Metabolism is essential for life, and its alteration is implicated in multiple human diseases. The transformation from a normal to a cancerous cell requires metabolic changes to fuel the high metabolic demands of cancer cells, including but not limited to cell proliferation and cell migration. In recent years, there have been a number of new discoveries connecting known aberrations in oncogenic and tumour suppressor pathways with metabolic alterations required to sustain cell proliferation and migration. However, an understanding of the selective advantage of these metabolic alterations is still lacking. Here, we review the literature on mathematical models of metabolism, with an emphasis on their contribution to the identification of the selective advantage of metabolic phenotypes that seem otherwise wasteful or accidental. We will show how the molecular hallmarks of cancer can be related to cell proliferation and tissue remodelling, the two major physiological requirements for the development of a multicellular structure. We will cover different areas such as genome-wide gene expression analysis, flux balance models, kinetic models, reaction diffusion models and models of the tumour microenvironment. We will also highlight current challenges and how their resolution will help to achieve a better understanding of cancer metabolism and the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancers. 1582260139\n",

There are risks for young people in this care context, and this study addressed the question: 'What is known about the identification, assessment and management of risk in young people (aged 11-18) with complex mental health needs entering, using and exiting inpatient child and adolescent mental health services in the UK?' In phase 1 a scoping search of two electronic databases (MEDLINE and PsychINFO) was undertaken. Items included were themed and presented to members of a stakeholder advisory group, who were asked to help prioritise the focus for phase 2. In phase 2, 17 electronic databases (EconLit; ASSIA; BNI; Cochrane Library; CINAHL; ERIC; EMBASE; HMIC; MEDLINE; PsycINFO; Scopus; Social Care Online; Social Services Abstracts; Sociological Abstracts; OpenGrey; TRiP; and Web of Science) were searched. Websites were explored and a call for evidence was circulated to locate items related to the risks to young people in mental health hospitals relating to 'dislocation' and 'contagion'. All types of evidence including research, policies and service and practice responses relating to outcomes, views and experiences, costs and cost-effectiveness were considered. Materials identified were narratively synthesised. In phase 1, 4539 citations were found and 124 items included. Most were concerned with clinical risks. In phase 2, 15,662 citations were found, and 40 addressing the risks of 'dislocation' and 'contagion' were included supplemented by 20 policy and guidance documents. The quality of studies varied. Materials were synthesised using the categories: Dislocation: Normal Life; Dislocation: Identity; Dislocation: Friends; Dislocation: Stigma; Dislocation: Education; Dislocation: Families; and Contagion. No studies included an economic analysis. Although we found evidence of consideration of risk to young people in these areas we found little evidence to improve practice and services. The importance to stakeholders of the risks of 'dislocation' and 'contagion' contrasted with the limited quantity and quality of evidence to inform policy, services and practice. The risks of dislocation and contagion are important, but new research is needed to inform how staff might identify, assess and manage them. yJWIoM@qq.com\n",

In low and middle income countries such as Uganda neuropsychiatric illness in childhood and adolescence represent 15-30 % of all loss in disability-adjusted life years. In spite of this burden, service systems in these countries are weak. The objective of our assessment was to explore strengths and weaknesses of CAMH systems at national and district level in Uganda from a management perspective. Seven key informant interviews were conducted during July to October 2014 in Kampala and Mbale district, Eastern Uganda representing the national and district level, respectively. The key informants selected were all public officials responsible for supervision of CAMH services at the two levels. The interview guide included the following CAMH domains based on the WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS): policy and legislation, financing, service delivery, health workforce, medicines and health information management. Inductive thematic analysis was applied in which the text in data transcripts was reduced to thematic codes. Patterns were then identified in the relations among the codes. Eleven themes emerged from the six domains of enquiry in the WHO-AIMS. A CAMH policy has been drafted to complement the national mental health policy, however district managers did not know about it. All managers at the district level cited inadequate national mental health policies. The existing laws were considered sufficient for the promotion of CAMH, however CAMH financing and services were noted by all as inadequate. CAMH services were noted to be absent at lower health centers and lacked integration with other health sector services. Insufficient CAMH workforce was widely reported, and was noted to affect medicines availability. Lastly, unlike national level managers, lower level managers considered the health management information system as being insufficient for service planning. Managers at national and district level agree that most components of the CAMH system in Uganda are weak; but perceptions about CAMH policy and health information systems were divergent. kxapDmiM@163.com\n",

      "Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is an effective and well-tolerated method of treating allergic respiratory diseases associated with seasonal and perennial allergens. In contrast to the subcutaneous route, SLIT requires a much greater amount of antigen to achieve a clinical effect. Many studies have shown that SLIT involves a dose-response relationship, and therefore it is important to use a proven clinically effective dose from the onset of treatment, because low doses are ineffective and very high doses may increase the risk of side effects. A well-defined standardization of allergen content is also crucial to ensure consistent quality, potency and appropriate immunomodulatory action of the SLIT product. Several methods of measuring antigenicity are used by manufacturers of SLIT products, including the index of reactivity (IR), standardized quality tablet unit, and bioequivalent allergy unit. A large body of evidence has established the 300 IR dose of SLIT as offering optimal efficacy and tolerability for allergic rhinitis due to grass and birch pollen and HDM, and HDM-induced moderate, persistent allergic asthma. The 300 IR dose also offers consistency of dosing across a variety of different allergens, and is associated with higher rates of adherence and patient satisfaction. Studies in patients with grass pollen allergies showed that the 300 IR dose has a rapid onset of action, is effective in both adults and children in the short term and, when administered pre-coseasonally in the long term, and maintains the clinical benefit, even after cessation of treatment. In patients with HDM-associated AR and/or asthma, the 300 IR dose also demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms and quality of life, and significantly decreased use of symptomatic medication. The 300 IR dose is well tolerated, with adverse events generally being of mild or moderate severity, declining in frequency and severity over time and in the subsequent courses. We discuss herein the most important factors that affect the selection of the optimal dose of SLIT with natural allergens, and review the rationale and evidence supporting the use of the 300 IR dose. +86-5138823786\n",

Considered together, the complexity of genomics data, due to its large volume and diversity along with the need for genomic data sharing, has resulted in the creation of Application Programming Interface (API) for secure, modular, interoperable access to genomic data from different applications, platforms, and even organizations. The Genomics APIs are a set of special protocols that assist software developers in dealing with multiple genomic data sources for building seamless, interoperable applications leading to the advancement of both genomic and clinical research. These APIs help define a standard for retrieval of genomic data from multiple sources as well as to better package genomic information for integration with Electronic Health Records. This review covers three currently available Genomics APIs: a) Google Genomics, b) SMART Genomics, and c) 23andMe. The functionalities, reference implementations (if available) and authentication protocols of each API are reviewed. A comparative analysis of the different features across the three APIs is provided in the Discussion section. Though Genomics APIs are still under active development and have yet to reach widespread adoption, they hold the promise to make building of complicated genomics applications easier with downstream constructive effects on healthcare.

Handwashing with soap removes pathogens from hands and reduces disease risk. A hepatitis E outbreak in the refugee camps of Maban County, South Sudan in 2012 prompted increased hygiene promotion and improved provision of soap, handwashing stations, and latrines. We conducted a study 1 year after the outbreak to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the refugees in Maban County. We conducted a cross sectional survey of female heads of households in three refugee camps in Maban County. We performed structured observations on a subset of households to directly observe their handwashing practices at times of possible pathogen transmission. Of the 600 households interviewed, nearly all had soap available and 91 % reported water was available \"\"always\"\" or \"\"sometimes\"\". Exposure to handwashing promotion was reported by 85 % of the respondents. Rinsing hands with water alone was more commonly observed than handwashing with soap at critical handwashing times including \"\"before eating\"\" (80 % rinsing vs. 7 % washing with soap) and \"\"before preparing/cooking food\"\" (72.3 % vs 23 %). After toilet use, 46 % were observed to wash hands with soap and an additional 38 % rinsed with water alone. Despite intensive messaging regarding handwashing with soap and access to soap and water, rinsing hands with water alone rather than washing hands with soap remains more common among the refugees in Maban County. This practice puts them at continued risk for communicable disease transmission. Qualitative research into local beliefs and more effective messaging may help future programs tailor handwashing interventions. 8nzz@163.com\n",

Here we address the consequences of a local induction of three Su(H) variants on Notch target gene expression. To this end, wild-type Su(H), a phospho-deficient Su(H) (MAPK-) (ko) and a phospho-mimetic Su(H) (MAPK-ac) isoform were overexpressed in the central domain of the wing anlagen. The expression of the Notch target genes cut, wingless, E(spl)m8-HLH and vestigial, was monitored. For the latter two, reporter genes were used (E(spl)m8-lacZ, vg (BE) -lacZ). In general, Su(H) (MAPK-) (ko) induced a stronger response than wild-type Su(H), whereas the response to Su(H) (MAPK-ac) was very weak. Notch target genes cut, wingless and vg (BE) -lacZ were ectopically activated, whereas E(spl)m8-lacZ was repressed by overexpression of Su(H) proteins. In addition, in epistasis experiments an activated form of the EGF-receptor (DER (act) ) or the MAPK (rl (SEM) ) and individual Su(H) variants were co-overexpressed locally, to compare the resultant phenotypes in adult flies (thorax, wings and eyes) as well as to assay the response of the Notch target gene cut in cell clones. +86-2991085848\n",

The results show that the atmospheric dynamics are sensitive to land surface conditions. The most sensitive parameters are dimensional parameters, i.e. roof width, aspect ratio, roughness length of heat and momentum, since these parameters control the magnitude of sensible heat flux. The relative insensitive parameters are hydrological parameters since the lawns or green roofs in urban areas are regularly irrigated so that the water availability for evaporation is never constrained.

      "The data of a corresponding animal experiment demonstrates that nebulized methacholine (MCh) induced severe bronchoconstriction and significant inhomogeneous ventilation and pulmonary perfusion (VA/Q) distribution in pigs, which is similar to findings in human asthma. The inhalation of MCh induced bronchoconstriction and delayed both uptake and elimination of desflurane (Kretzschmar et al., 2015) [1]. The objective of the present data is to determine VA/Q matching by Multiple Inert Gas Elimination Technique (MIGET) in piglets before and during methacholine- (MCh-) induced bronchoconstriction, induced by MCh infusion, and to assess the blood concentration profiles for desflurane (DES) by Micropore Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry (MMIMS). Healthy piglets (n=4) under general anesthesia were instrumented with arterial, central venous, and pulmonary artery lines. The airway was secured via median tracheostomy with an endotracheal tube, and animals were mechanically ventilated with intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with a FiO2 of 0.4, tidal volume (V T)=10 ml/kg and PEEP of 5cmH2O using an open system. The determination of V.A/Q. was done by MIGET: before desflurane application and at plateau in both healthy state and during MCh infusion. Arterial blood was sampled at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min during wash-in and washout, respectively. Bronchoconstriction was established by MCH infusion aiming at doubling the peak airway pressure, after which wash-in and washout of the anesthetic gas was repeated. Anesthesia gas concentrations were measured by MMIMS. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, paired t-test, and by nonparametric Friedman's test and Wilcoxon's matched pairs test. We measured airway pressures, pulmonary resistance, and mean paO2 as well as hemodynamic variables in all pigs before desflurane application and at plateau in both healthy state and during methacholine administration by infusion. By MIGET, fractional alveolar ventilation and pulmonary perfusion in relation to the V.A/Q. compartments, data of logSDQ and logSDV (the second moments describing global dispersion, i.e. heterogeneity of distribution) were estimated prior to and after MCh infusion. The uptake and elimination of desflurane was determined by MMIMS. 12062696809\n",

      "Epidemiological analyses of aggregated data are often used to evaluate theoretical health effects of natural disasters. Such analyses are susceptible to confounding by unmeasured differences between the exposed and unexposed populations. To demonstrate the difference-in-difference method our population included all recorded Florida live births that reached 20 weeks gestation and conceived after the first hurricane of 2004 or in 2003 (when no hurricanes made landfall). Hurricane exposure was categorized using >=74 mile per hour hurricane wind speed as well as a 60 km spatial buffer based on weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The effect of exposure was quantified as live birth rate differences and 95 % confidence intervals [RD (95 % CI)]. To illustrate sensitivity of the results, the difference-in-differences estimates were compared to general linear models adjusted for census-level covariates. This analysis demonstrates difference-in-differences as a method to control for time-invariant confounders investigating hurricane exposure on live birth rates. Difference-in-differences analysis yielded consistently null associations across exposure metrics and hurricanes for the post hurricane rate difference between exposed and unexposed areas (e.g., Hurricane Ivan for 60 km spatial buffer [-0.02 births/1000 individuals (-0.51, 0.47)]. In contrast, general linear models suggested a positive association between hurricane exposure and birth rate [Hurricane Ivan for 60 km spatial buffer (2.80 births/1000 individuals (1.94, 3.67)] but not all models. Ecological studies of associations between environmental exposures and health are susceptible to confounding due to unmeasured population attributes.

      "Development of cerebral eyes is generally based on fine-tuned networks and closely intertwined with the formation of brain and head. Consistently and best studied in insects and vertebrates, many signaling pathways relaying the activity of eye developmental factors to positional information in the head region are characterized. Though known from several organisms, photoreceptors developing outside the head region are much less studied and the course of their development, relation to cerebral eyes and evolutionary origin is in most cases unknown. To explore how position influences development of otherwise similar photoreceptors, we analyzed the molecular characteristics of photoreceptors we discovered at the very anterior, the posttrochal mid-body and posterior body region of larval Leptochiton asellus, a representative of the chiton subgroup of mollusks. Irrespective of their position, all found photoreceptors exhibit a molecular signature highly similar to cerebral eye photoreceptors of related animals. All photoreceptors employ the same subtype of visual pigments (r-opsin), and the same key elements for phototransduction such as GNAq, trpC and arrestin and intracellular r-opsin transport such as rip11 and myosinV as described from other protostome cerebral eyes. Several transcription factors commonly involved in cerebral eye and brain development such as six1/2, eya, dachshund, lhx2/9 and prox are also expressed by all found photoreceptor cells, only pax6 being restricted to the anterior most cells. Coexpression of pax6 and MITF in photoreceptor-associated shielding pigment cells present at the mid-body position matches the common situation in cerebral eye retinal pigment epithelium specification and differentiation. Notably, all photoreceptors, even the posterior ones, further express clear anterior markers such as foxq2, irx, otx, and six3/6 (only the latter absent in the most posterior photoreceptors), which play important roles in the early patterning of the anterior neurogenic area throughout the animal kingdom. Our data suggest that anterior eyes with brain-associated development can indeed be subject to heterotopic replication to developmentally distinct and even posterior body regions. Retention of the transcriptional activity of a broad set of eye developmental factors and common anterior markers suggests a mode of eye development induction, which is largely independent of body regionalization. 1418934114\n",

      "Despite the lack of biochemical information, all available in silico metabolic models of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 consider NADP as the only cofactor accepted by the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases. Because the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is the main glycolytic route in this bacterium, determining how much NADH and NADPH are produced in the reaction catalyzed by these enzymes is very important for the correct interpretation of metabolic flux distributions. To determine the actual cofactor preference of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded by the zwf-1 gene (PputG6PDH-1), the major isoform during growth on glucose, we purified this protein and studied its kinetic properties. Based on simple kinetic principles, we estimated the in vivo relative production of NADH and NADPH during the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Contrary to the general assumption, our calculations showed that the reaction catalyzed by PputG6PDH-1 yields around 1/3 mol of NADPH and 2/3 mol of NADH per mol of oxidized G6P. Additionally, we obtained data suggesting that the reaction catalyzed by the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is active during growth on glucose, and it also produces NADH. These results indicate that the stoichiometric matrix of in silico models of P. putida KT2440 must be corrected and highlight the importance of considering the physiological concentrations of the involved metabolites to estimate the actual proportion of NADH and NADPH produced by a dehydrogenase. +86-2303819508\n",

It is based on the assumption that at the time of the crime, the defendant was suffering from severe mental illness and therefore, was incapable of appreciating the nature of the crime and differentiating right from wrong behavior, hence making them not legally accountable for crime.

Pearson's product moment correlation was the used as the test of association. Stepwise linear regression was used to identify predictors of suicide intent. Suicide intent was significantly correlated with verbal aggression (Pearson r = 0.90, P = 0.030), hostility (Pearson r = 0.316, P < 0.001), and nonplanning impulsivity (r = -0.174, P = 0.049). High hostility and low motor impulsivity emerged as significant predictors of suicide intent. Personality traits such as hostility and to an extent, impulsivity are accurate predictors of intentionality in attempted suicide.

      "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous condition with a few major symptom dimensions. These symptom dimensions are thought to have unique clinical and neurobiological correlates. There seems to be a specific relation between OCD symptom dimensions and obsessive beliefs, but the findings are not consistent across studies. There is also a paucity of literature from culturally diverse settings. One of the reasons for the varied findings could be due to the method employed in measuring OCD symptoms. In this study, we examined the relation between symptom dimensions and obsessive beliefs using the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire respectively in 75 patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition OCD. Perfectionism predicted both aggressive and symmetry dimensions whereas responsibility beliefs predicted sexual and religious dimensions. The findings suggest that certain obsessive beliefs predicted certain OCD symptom dimensions, but results are not entirely consistent with the published literature suggesting the possibility of cross-cultural variations. That the symptom dimensions have unique belief domains support the argument that symptom dimensions could be targeted to reduce the heterogeneity in etiological and treatment studies of OCD. Therapeutic interventions may have to aim at modifying unique belief domains underlying certain symptom dimensions rather than having generic cognitive-behavioral strategies. 2MnkwR@qq.com\n",

However, understanding factors influencing functioning in the immediate recovery period following an acute exacerbation may be of important clinical relevance. The aim of this study is to assess the factors that influence well-being and socio-occupational functioning following an acute exacerbation in schizophrenia patients. The study included 40 patients during the period from June 2013 to June 2014. The possible effect of gender, duration of illness, duration of untreated psychosis, premorbid adjustment, cognitive impairment, facial affect perception and treatment compliance on well-being, and socio-occupational functioning was examined. About 45% of the individuals experienced below average well-being. On logistic regression analysis poor compliance with medication and poorer cognitive functioning significantly differentiated the patient group with below average well-being from those with an above average well-being. Male gender, poor premorbid adjustment, poor compliance to treatment, poor cognitive functioning, and greater duration of untreated psychosis were found to be associated with a poorer socio-occupational functioning. Clinical interventions focusing on improving cognitive impairment and compliance to treatment could play a role in improving well-being, and socio-occupational functioning in schizophrenia patients following an acute exacerbation. 1687027801\n",

      "Most of the studies have looked into the effect of typical antipsychotics on speech secondary to tardive dyskinesia. This study was aimed to explore the factors predicting the effect of atypical antipsychotic medications on the production of speech. One hundred and forty patients on stable regimen of three or more months on risperidone (92), olanzapine (28), aripiprazole (14), and clozapine (6) were recruited for the study. Speech was assessed by maximum phonation duration task, s/z ratio, diadochokinetic task, acoustic analysis and Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA). Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed by Simpson Angus scale. Spearman correlation analysis was carried out to find the association between speech parameters and continuous variables. Effect of EPS, duration and dose of antipsychotic treatment on speech parameters was compared using Mann-Whitney test. The risperidone group differ from other antipsychotics groups significantly in s/z ratio (0.07), FDA-total (0.23) and FDA-reflex (0.25). People who took antipsychotic for more than 2 years had lower score of FDA-palate (P = 0.042), and FDA-respiratory (P = 0.04) and higher values in noise-harmonic ratio (P = 0.011) and maximum /fundamental frequency (MFF) for males (P = 0.02). Effect of EPS was seen on MFF for males (spearman correlation coefficient = 0.34) and on almost all sections of FDA (spearman correlation coefficients = -0.2 to -0.33). Both duration of use and propensity of atypical antipsychotics to cause EPS can influence the speech performance of the patients. This information can be useful, particularly in people with the requirement of high quality speech. KS1R@163.com\n",

      "Physical and mental comorbidity is common and has significant implications for overall health outcomes. Psoriasis, a psychocutaneous disorder, is a classic example of mental-physical comorbidity. In view of the impact of socio-cultural influences on mind-body interactions and the paucity of Indian research pertaining to psychiatric morbidity in psoriatic patients, this study was undertaken to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with psoriasis, and to correlate these with severity of psoriasis and quality of life. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 90 consecutive patients of psoriasis, over a period of 12 months, in a tertiary care centre. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index was used to assess severity of psoriasis. PHQ-9, GAD-7 and the Perceived Stress Scale were used to screen for depression, anxiety and perceived stress respectively. The WHOQOL-BREF was used to determine the quality of life. All analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel software and Statistical Package for Social Sciences. A total of 71 (78.9%) subjects had depression and 69 (76.7%) had anxiety. Fifty one patients had significant stress. A significant positive correlation was established between psoriasis variables (severity and duration of psoriasis) and psychological variables (depression, anxiety and stress). Severity of psoriasis had a significant negative correlation with social relationships and environmental domains of WHOQOL. Quality of life was significantly worse in patients with psoriasis with comorbid anxiety/depression. Patients with psoriasis have a clinically significant prevalence of depression, anxiety and perceived stress. This study highlights the complex relationship between psoriasis, psychiatric comorbidity and quality of life and the need to simultaneously consider dermatological and psychological factors. 1438346028\n",

Prompt and effective treatment of CIS may assist treatment tolerability, adherence, and better outcomes in patients with treatment nonresponsive schizophrenia. The beneficial effect of amisulpride augmentation of clozapine therapy for such patients may be enhanced by its anti-salivatory effect on CIS. Current series of five subjects who developed CIS that responded poorly to anticholinergic drugs found drastic improvement in daytime and nocturnal CIS with very low-dose (50-100 mg/day) of amisulpride. Low-dose amisulpride augmentation may also provide strong ameliorating effect on CIS.

Additionally, there have been certain additions and omissions from the earlier version. Critical evaluation of the changes made to the section on disorders related to use of psychoactive substances in India context has not been published so far. The current paper presents a critique of the changes made to the substance use disorder section in DSM-5. The rationale for these changes put forth by DSM-5 work group on substance related disorders have been discussed. Additionally, attempt has been made to highlight the possible future challenges consequent to the current nosological revision for substance use disorder category. Overall DSM-5 seems to be promising in fulfilling its goal of DSM-ICD harmonisation and movement towards an internationally compatible and practical diagnostic system for mental health disorders. It has increased the scope of addiction by inclusion of behavioural addiction. It has also tried to balance the categorical and dimensional approach to diagnosis. However, the real test of this newer edition of one of the most commonly used nosological systems will be during clinical care and research.

      "Some patients with bowel cancer have significant comorbidities, making them unfit for major surgery under general anaesthesia. However, treatment without surgery offers no possibility of cure, and furthermore, symptom control may be poor. We investigated the possibility of performing these resections under local anaesthesia in patients with a slim body habitus in a cohort of patients rejected for general anaesthesia. Eight patients (4 M, 4 F) aged 77-89 were included in this study. All had significant comorbidities and were deemed unfit for general anaesthesia by the consultant anaesthetist in charge of pre assessing high-risk patients. All patients had undergone a thorough assessment, which included P-POSSUM scoring. The recruited patients underwent a careful and fully informed consenting process, leading to standard cancer resections. These resections occurred between 2005 and 2012, under combined local anaesthesia and sedation. The operations undertaken were four right hemicolectomies (for caecal cancer), two Hartmann's procedures (for sigmoid cancer), one Hartmann's procedure with en bloc small bowel resection (for sigmoid cancer invading small bowel) and one transverse colectomy (for mid transverse colon cancer). Seven patients survived radical surgery without complications, although one died from an unrelated cause 8 months after surgery. One of these surviving patients subsequently underwent CABG and further bowel surgery under GA 2 years later for a metachronous sigmoid cancer. There was one postoperative death due to cardiogenic shock on the third postoperative day. Radical cancer resections under local anaesthesia are feasible in suitably selected high-risk patients with acceptable mortality and comparable medium- to long-term results. Njoca@fudan.edu.cn\n",

However, recent literature has called the blanket use of the DRE on each trauma patient into question. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the DRE as a diagnostic tool in the setting of urethral, spinal cord, small bowel, colon, and rectal injuries and determine if it can be eliminated from routine use in the trauma setting. Trauma patients with small bowel, colon, rectal, urethral, and spinal cord injuries, age of 18 years or older, and a noted DRE were included. Exclusion criteria included an age less than 18, patients who received paralytics, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, and a history of paraplegia or quadriplegia. One-hundred eleven patient records were retrospectively reviewed. Ninety-two male (82.9 %) and 19 (17.1 %) females with a GCS of 13.7 were evaluated. Sixty-two (55.9 %) injuries were penetrating with 49 (44.1) being blunt. The DRE missed 100 % of urethral, 91.7 % of spinal cord, 93.1 % of small bowel, 100 % of colon, and 66.7 % of rectal injuries. For injuries confirmed with radiologic modalities, the DRE missed 93.3 %. For injuries confirmed on exploratory laparotomy, the DRE missed 94.9 %. The DRE has poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of urethral, spinal cord, small bowel, and large bowel injury. The DRE was found to be the most sensitive in the setting of rectal injuries. The DRE offers no benefit or predictive value when compared to other imaging modalities. ZFODRS@qq.com\n",

Between January 2008 and March 2013, 56 patients (36 male, 20 female; mean age 25.6 years, age range 16-39 years) underwent single-port microthoracoscopic thoracic sympathicotomy for palmar hyperhidrosis. Nineteen patients (33.9 %) had moderate palmar hyperhidrosis that could thoroughly wet a handkerchief, and 37 (66.1 %) had severe palmar hyperhidrosis with sweat dripping from the palm. Eight patients (14.3 %) had a positive family history, 34 (60.7 %) had plantar hyperhidrosis, 22 (39.3 %) had axillary hyperhidrosis, and 20 (35.7 %) had both plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis. In addition, 21 patients (37.5 %) had palmar pompholyx, five (8.9 %) had keratolysis exfoliativa, 10 (17.9 %) had chilblains, and nine (16.1 %) had palmar rhagades. A single 10-mm skin incision was made in the third intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, posterior to the pectoralis muscle. A 5-mm microthoracoscope and a 3-mm microelectrocautery hook were inserted through a single port into the thoracic cavity. The third and fourth ribs were identified, and the sympathetic chain was cut using the microelectrocautery hook. The bypassing nerve fibers, such as the Kuntz nerve fiber bundle, were ablated for 2-3 cm along the surface of the rib. The palmar temperature was recorded before and after sympathicotomy. All 56 procedures were completed using single-port microthoracoscopy. No postoperative complications such as hemorrhage, wound infection, hemopneumothorax, bradycardia, or Horner's syndrome were observed. Bilateral procedures were completed in 20-56 min (mean 30 min). The palmar temperature increased by 2.2 +- 0.3 degC after surgery. The postoperative hospital stay was 1-4 days (mean 2.5 days). Mild compensatory sweating of the back and thigh occurred in five patients (8.9 %) at 2-3 days after surgery and disappeared at 7-15 days. The patients were followed up for 28.5 months (range 1-62 months). Hyperhidrosis resolved in both hands after surgery, and the previously wet, cold hands became dry and warm. The efficacy rate was 100 %. Plantar hyperhidrosis was also significantly reduced in 33 of the 34 patients with this condition (remission rate 97.1 %), and axillary hyperhidrosis was significantly reduced in 19 of 22 patients (remission rate 86.4 %). Eighteen of the 20 patients (90.0 %) with both plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis experienced significant alleviation of their symptoms. Single-port microthoracoscopic thoracic sympathicotomy is a safe, convenient, and effective method of treating palmar hyperhidrosis. This procedure can accurately locate the sympathetic chain with a small incision, minimal invasiveness, and good cosmetic results. The procedure is suitable for extensive clinical use. lmjL2vf@qq.com\n",

However, indications, perioperative findings, and outcome of the device for hepatic resections remain and deserve to be analyzed. The current study aims to analyze the feasibility of the bipolar radiofrequency device (Habib(r)) for hepatic resections. Information of the patients that underwent hepatic resection using with the Habib(r) device between 2007 and 2011 was abstracted. Patient, disease, and operation-related findings and perioperative data were investigated. A total of 71 cases (38 [53.5 %] males, mean age was 56.8 +- 11.9) were analyzed. Metastatic disease (n = 55; 77.5 %) was the leading indication followed by primary liver and biliary malignancies (n = 7; 9.9 %), hemangioma (n = 5; 7 %), hydatid disease (n = 3; 2.8 %), and hepatic gunshot trauma (n = 1; 1.4 %). Metastasectomy was the most commonly performed procedure (n = 31; 56.3 %), but in 24 (77.4 %) cases, it was performed in addition to extended resections. Other procedures in the study patients include segmentectomy in 17, bisegmentectomy in 19, trisegmentectomy in 17, right or left hepatectomy in 8, and extended right/left hepatectomy in 3. The mean (+-SD) operation time was 241.7 +- 78.2 min. The median amount of bleeding was 300 cc (range 25-2500), and 23 (32.4 %) cases required perioperative transfusion. The median hospitalization period was 5 days (range 1-47). Lengthened drainage (n = 9, 12.7 %) and intraabdominal abscess (n = 8, 11.23 %) were the most common problems. Hepatic resections using the Habib(r) device seem to be feasible in cases with primary and metastatic hepatic lesions and benign liver masses and even those with hepatic trauma.

The aim of this study was to determine if preoperative total cholesterol levels are associated with a higher risk of postoperative infections and mortality. A total of 2211 patients undergoing general surgical procedures between December 2006 and November 2008 at Iizuka Hospital and between January 2010 and March 2012 at Jichi Medical University Hospital were reviewed. Multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate serum total cholesterol and other variables as predictors of postoperative nosocomial infections. Serum total cholesterol concentrations lower than 160 mg/dl were associated with an increased incidence of superficial and deep incisional surgical site infections. Serum total cholesterol levels showed a reverse J-shaped relationship with the development of organ space surgical site infection and pneumonia. There was no discernible effect of serum cholesterol levels on the postoperative mortality observed in this cohort of patients. Decreased serum albumin was one of the strongest risk factors for the development of nosocomial infection after surgery. Postoperative pneumonia was not observed in patients taking statin medications whose cholesterol levels were <200 mg/dl. Serum total cholesterol may be a valid predictor of surgical outcome. Preoperative statin use may affect the development of postoperative pneumonia in patients with total cholesterol levels below 200 mg/dl. yjJuKi6@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

In this educational interventional study, only clean and clean-contaminated surgeries were included. Preinterventional study was done by collecting data regarding the use of surgical prophylaxis in the Department of Surgery. After analyzing the preinterventional data, educational intervention was done. A pretest questionnaire was given to all the surgeons to assess knowledge and practice of surgical prophylaxis in our institute. The questionnaire was designed to collect information regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotic, its duration, time of administration, and prevention of surgical site infections (SSI). In our study, third-generation cephalosporin was used in maximum cases in preinterventional analysis and prophylaxis was continued for 3-5 days. Surgeon's decision in selecting a prophylactic agent was based on information taken from departmental colleagues or drug companies. Two or more doses of antibiotic were used even when duration of surgery did not exceed more than two and half hours. Definite improvement was seen after the education where single antibiotic was used as prophylactic drug and the first dose of antibiotic was administered 30 to 60 min before incision. This shows that educational intervention makes a change in antibiotic prescribing habit. Hence, there is an urgent need for adoption of specific guidelines to ensure standardization of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis practices in hospitals. 1644561372\n",

Lung hypoplasia, remodeled pulmonary vasculature, and ventricular dysfunction all contribute to the high morbidity and mortality associated with CDH. In addition, genetic syndromes associated with CDH can increase the incidence of serious anomalies and hence impact survival. Prenatal and postnatal management of infants with CDH is challenging in the best of circumstances and need multidisciplinary teams for optimal outcomes. However, advances using ultrasound and fetal MRI can predict prognosis and survival and plan for postnatal management. Survival rates for patients with CDH have increased for the past decade with better management at resuscitation; implementation of gentle ventilation strategies; and medical management of pulmonary hypertension, physiologic stabilization, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

      "Introduction of synthetic mesh was a landmark breakthrough in the management of hernia repair and has significantly reduced recurrence rates. But in addition to the benefits, some more problems have come in picture major being 'mesh infection'. Prolene mesh has shown promise when used in abdominal and inguinal hernia repair, especially when used in planned surgeries. This material, derived from monofilament polypropelene, is found to be biologically inert in almost every person. Being a foreign material, a slightest breach in asepsis can lead to favourable environment for bacterial proliferation and form a 'biofilm'. This phenomenon especially after laparoscopic surgeries gives rise to chronic discharging sinus at the port site, abscess formation around mesh and even sepsis. It appears that laparoscopic hernia repair is a promising method but having chances of mesh infection owing to difficult approach and lack of uniformity in sterilization of laparoscopic instruments. Slightest breach in sterility or protocols might lead to such a large ventral wall sinus, increasing morbidity and cost of treatment. Treatment of infected mesh is possible by local debridement, irrigation, mesh removal and systemic antibiotics culminating in increased morbidity over duration of disease, but still it would be worth emphasizing-'Prevention is better than cure'. +86-28719837594\n",

      "To investigate the differences in outcomes among patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer on NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocols 9906 and 0233 who achieved complete response and near-complete response after induction chemoradiation and then completed bladder-preserving therapy with chemoradiation therapy (chemo-RT) to full dose (60-64 Gy). A pooled analysis was performed on 119 eligible patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer enrolled on NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials 9906 and 0233, who were classified as having a complete (T0) or near-complete (Ta or Tis) response after induction chemo-RT and completed consolidation with a total RT dose of at least 60 Gy. Bladder recurrence, salvage cystectomy rates, and disease-specific survival were estimated by the cumulative incidence method and bladder-intact and overall survivals by the Kaplan-Meier method. Among the 119 eligible patients, 101 (85%) achieved T0, and 18 (15%) achieved Ta or Tis after induction chemo-RT and proceeded to consolidation. After a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 36 of 101 T0 patients (36%) versus 5 of 18 Ta or Tis patients (28%) experienced bladder recurrence (P=.52). Thirteen patients among complete responders eventually required late salvage cystectomy for tumor recurrence, compared with 1 patient among near-complete responders (P=.63). Disease-specific, bladder-intact, and overall survivals were not significantly different between T0 and Ta/Tis cases. The bladder recurrence and salvage cystectomy rates of the complete and the near-complete responders were similar. Therefore it is reasonable to recommend that patients with Ta or Tis after induction chemo-RT continue with bladder-sparing therapy with consolidation chemo-RT to full dose (60-64 Gy).

      "Almost all supraglottic airways (SGAs) are now available in pediatric sizes. The availability of these smaller sizes, especially in the last five years has brought a marked change in the whole approach to airway management in children. SGAs are now used for laparoscopic surgeries, head and neck surgeries, remote anesthesia; and for ventilation during resuscitation. A large number of reports have described the use of SGAs in difficult airway situations, either as a primary or a rescue airway. Despite this expanded usage, there remains little evidence to support its usage in prolonged surgeries and in the intensive care unit. This article presents an overview of the current options available, suitability of one over the other and reviews the published data relating to each device. In this review, the author also addresses some of the general concerns regarding the use of SGAs and explores newer roles of their use in children. 1341137878\n",

      "We proposed a review of present literature and systematic analysis of present literature to summarize the evidence on the use of b-blockers on the outcome of a patient with severe sepsis and septic shock. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library were searched from 1946 to December 2013. The bibliography of all relevant articles was hand searched. Full-text search of the grey literature was done through the medical institution database. The database search identified a total of 1241 possible studies. The citation list was hand searched by both the authors. A total of 9 studies were identified. Most studies found a benefit from b-blocker administration in sepsis. This included improved heart rate (HR) control, decreased mortality and improvement in acid-base parameters. Chronic b-blocker usage in sepsis was also associated with improved mortality. The administration of b-blockers during sepsis was associated with better control of HR. The methodological quality of all the included studies, however, was poor. There is insufficient evidence to justify the routine use of b-blockers in sepsis. A large adequately powered multi-centered randomized controlled clinical trial is required to address the question on the efficacy of b-blocker usage in sepsis. This trial should also consider a number of important questions including the choice of b-blocker used, optimal dosing, timing of intervention, duration of intervention and discontinuation of the drug. Until such time based on the available evidence, there is no place for the use of b-blockers in sepsis in current clinical practice. 1146639323\n",

      "Bupivacaine is more cardiotoxic than ropivacaine. Ropivacaine provides effective spinal anesthesia for lower limb and hip surgeries. This prospective study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine with hyperbaric bupivacaine for patients undergoing limb and hip surgeries. Two hundred patients aged 40-75 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II of either gender were randomly divided into Group R (Ropivacaine) and Group B (Bupivacaine) to receive an intrathecal injection of 3 ml of hyperbaric ropivacaine 0.5% or 3 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%, respectively. Onset and duration of sensory blockade were determined using the pinprick method by a three-point scale at T-10 dermatome. Onset and duration of motor block were assessed by modified Bromage scale. Duration of postoperative analgesia, hemodynamic changes, central nervous system and cardiovascular system toxicity or any adverse effects were observed. The mean onset of sensory block (6 +- 1.3 min vs. 3 +- 1.1 min; P < 0.001) and motor block (13 +- 1.6 min vs. 9 +- 1.3 min; P < 0.05) was significantly slower in ropivacaine group as compared to bupivacaine group. The total duration of sensory block was significantly shorter in the ropivacaine group (160 +- 12.9 min) than in the bupivacaine group (260 +- 16.1 min; P < 0.05). The mean duration of motor block was also shorter in the ropivacaine group compared to bupivacaine group (126 +- 9.2 min vs. 174 +- 12.6 min; P < 0.05). Quality of anesthesia was comparable in two groups (P = 0.04). We conclude that hyperbaric bupivacaine used intrathecally has a faster onset of sensory block and prolonged duration of analgesia compared to hyperbaric ropivacaine. 17533104165\n",

Forty-eight patients were randomized to four groups in a double-blinded fashion. All groups received an initial 10 ml/h of epidural study solution for 24 h. The solution contained: 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, or 0.025% ropivacaine for Groups I-IV, respectively, with fentanyl 3.0 mg/ml and epinephrine 0.5 mg/ml. Patients could administer additional PCEA doses of 4 ml of their study solution with a lock-out time of 10 min. Overall satisfaction, side-effects, motor block, neurologic function, and pain using Visual Analog Scale were assessed. Patients in all groups showed no difference in sedation, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and uterine cramps. Pain scores at rest were lower for Group IV than Groups I-III (P < 0.001). Twelve, five, one, and zero patients could not ambulate in Groups I-IV, respectively. Nine, nine, two, and zero (III <I and II, P = 0.02; IV P = 0.001) patients reported urinary retention in Groups I-IV, respectively. Overall satisfaction scores were high for all groups. Neonatal behavior score was similar and high in all groups. 0.025% ropivacaine PCEA combined with fentanyl and epinephrine provided effective pain relief after cesarean section with early ambulation and without sensory loss, urinary retention, or increase of side-effects. gPJM8d@qq.com\n",

      "Continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA) has not been widely used for postoperative analgesia, mainly to avoid complications from the subarachnoid injection. Recently, the introduction of low caliber CSA catheters (Spinocath((r))), has allowed to decrease anesthetics doses and volumes with good analgesia and reduced complications. The aim of this present study was to compare two concentrations of levobupivacaine administered through CSA for postoperative pain management after major orthopedic surgery. Secondary outcomes were adverse events associated with CSA. Thirty-two patients were randomized to receive sufentanil 1 mcg/h plus levobupivacaine 0.125%-1 ml/h (Group A0.125) or 0.0625%-2 ml/h (Group B0.0625) for postoperative analgesia through CSA catheter, connected to the elastomeric pump over 48 h. The quality of analgesia was assessed based on pain intensity by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). Sensory and motor function, hemodynamic, and respiratory parameters were recorded for 96 h after surgery, after which the catheter was removed. In addition, joint mobility was assessed, and any side effects were noted. VAS score was <=30 mm in 25 patients. Three patients in Group A0.125 and 4 in Group B0.0625 (NS), received a rescue dose of levobupivacaine. Median VAS in Group A0.125 was lower than in Group B0.0625 on T1 h (8 +- 11 vs 16 +- 11; P < 0.05), and on T4 h (11 +- 8 vs 18 +- 1; P < 0.05). All patients remained hemodynamically stable. There were no significant differences between groups for postoperative joints mobility. Levobupivacaine at a dose of 1.25 mg/h administered by CSA provides good quality analgesia independent of concentration and solution volume in patients undergoing total knee and hip replacement. 1308006069\n",

This randomized double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of adding clonidine to bupivacaine and bupivacaine-fentanyl combination. A total of 100 patients scheduled for surgery under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 25 each) to receive intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg plus normal saline 0.5 ml (group BS), intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg, and fentanyl 25 mg (group BF), intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg and clonidine 75 mg (group BC), intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg, clonidine 37.5 mg, and fentanyl 12.5 mg (group BCF). The time of onset and duration of sensory block, highest dermatome level of sensory block, time of onset of motor block, time to complete motor block recovery and duration of spinal anesthesia, intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamics and side effects if any were recorded. VAS, total number of patients who were administered supplemental analgesic in each group and the total amount of supplemental analgesic administered in the next 24 h was quantified and documented in all the groups. The time of onset of sensory block (min) in groups BS, BC, BCF, and BF was 10.80 +- 2.26, 10.20 +- 1.00, 10.00 +- 0.00, and 13.80 +- 2.61 respectively, thus onset of sensory block was significantly earlier in groups BC and BCF. Similarly, onset of motor block was also quicker in groups BC and BCF. Time of requirement of supplemental analgesia was 135.20 +- 12.70 min, 199.2 +- 21.92 min, 209.80 +- 26.32 min, and 208.00 +- 26.58 min in groups BS, BF, BC, and BCF respectively. Intraoperative and postoperative changes in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were comparable. Sedation scores were significantly higher in group BC. Pruritus was only observed in groups BF and BCF. Mean nausea vomiting scores were comparable in all groups. We conclude that the addition of clonidine in doses of 75 mg and 37.5 mg to low-dose bupivacaine and bupivacaine-fentanyl prolongs the sensory and motor block while increasing the duration of postoperative analgesia without significant side-effects. 17961905096\n",

      "A high percentage of patients undergoing arthroscopic repairs on day care basis complain of inadequate postoperative pain relief. Clonidine was evaluated for the best route as an adjuvant in regional anesthesia in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair to prolong analgesia. A prospective randomized double-blinded study was planned in a tertiary care hospital in North India in which 85 American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients undergoing ACL repair were enrolled. All groups received 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally as in control group C. Group IT received intrathecal 1 mg/kg of clonidine along with hyperbaric bupivacaine, group IA received 0.25% bupivacaine and 1 mg/kg clonidine intra-articularly, and group NB received 0.25% bupivacaine and 1 mg/kg clonidine in femoro-sciatic nerve block (FSNB). Postoperative pain free interval and block characteristics were the primary outcomes studied. Pain-free duration was 546.90 (+-93.66) min in group NB (P < 0.001) in comparison to 234.90 (+-20.99), 367.80 (+-47.40) and 172.20 (+-54.82) min in groups IA, IT and C, respectively. Sensory block and motor blockade in NB were 474.90 (+-43.80) and 267.40 (+-34.59) min, respectively, and were significantly prolonged (P > 0.001) in comparison to other groups. The mean rescue analgesic requirement and cumulative frequency of rescue analgesia were least in group NB, followed by groups IT, IA and C. Clonidine is safe and effective adjuvant with bupivacaine in prolonging analgesia through various routes employed for post knee surgery pain. The maximum prolongation of analgesia is achieved through FSNB with a risk of prolonging postanesthesia care unit stay. IVrxnY@fudan.edu.cn\n",

      "Most central venous catheters are placed using Seldinger guide wires. EN ISO 11070 is the guideline for testing guide wire flexing performance and tensile strength, and we can safely assume that guide wires in use meet these requirements. Unfortunately, EN ISO 11070 guidelines do not reflect the clinical requirements and we continue to see mechanical failures and their associated complications. This in vitro study was performed in an accredited laboratory. With regard to flexing, we: (1) Established the minimum flexing performance needed to meet clinical requirements, (2) developed flexing performance tests which mimic clinical requirement, and (3) evaluated the mechanical properties of various guide wires relative to these requirements. With regard to tensile strength, we used the testing method prescribed in ISO 11070, but did not end the test at 5 Newton (N). We continued until the guide wire was damaged, or we reached maximum tractive force. We then did a wire-to-wire comparison. We examined two basic wire constructions, monofil and core and coil. Tensile strength: All wires tested, except one, met EN ISO 11070 requirements for 5 N tensile strength. The mean of the wire types tested ranged from 15.06 N to 257.76 N. Flexing performance: None of the wires kinked. The monofil had no evidence of bending. Two core/coil wires displayed minor bending (angle 1.5deg). All other wires displayed bending angles between 22.5deg and 43.0deg. We recommend that: (1) Clinicians use guide wires with high-end mechanical properties, (2) EN ISO 11070 incorporate our flexing test into their testing method, raise the flexing requirement to kink-proof, (3) and raise the tensile strength requirement to a minimum of 30 N, and (3) all manufacturers and suppliers be required to display mechanical properties of all guide wire, and guide wire kits sold. 1307874533\n",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) pretreatment on the speed of anesthesia induction with sevoflurane. Eighty patients scheduled for hysteroscopy under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to inhale for 10 min before induction 50% N2O in oxygen or air via a facemask. Anesthesia was induced with 7-8% sevoflurane in oxygen via a facemask. Bispectral index (BIS), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) tidal volume, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and heart rate were recorded every minute during the 10 min pretreatment periods and every 30 s during the first 300 s of induction with sevoflurane. During induction of anesthesia inspired and end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations were also recorded. During the 10 min of inspired 50% N2O or air BIS, EtCO2, tidal volume, respiratory rate and heart rate values did not differ between the two groups except for the SpO2, which was higher in the N2O group (P < 0.001). During induction of anesthesia the N2O group exhibited lower BIS values (P = 0.001), being significant at 60-150 s (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.014) as well as at 270 s (P = 0.004).

For 176 patients requiring CS, LE utilization for surgical anesthesia was 52.8% (93/176) and factors identified for not utilizing LE in 47% (83/176) were; failure to achieve surgical anesthesia in 6.8% (12/176), emergency CS in 28.4% (50/176), patient preference in 6.8% (12/176) and inadequate labor pain relief with LE in 5.1% (9/176) patients. Non-obstetric anesthesiologists were involved in 59% (49/83) of cases where LE was not used for CS. LE had no effect on the rate of CS; however it significantly increased (P < 0.01) the rate of assisted delivery. Factors like inadequate LE, emergency situations and non-obstetric anesthesiologists can all be responsible for failed conversion of LE to surgical anesthesia for CS. +86-4922434890\n",

      "We aimed to evaluate and compare the block characteristics and duration of analgesia of intrathecal isobaric ropivacaine-fentanyl and bupivacaine-fentanyl combination in adult patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery. Seventy-four American Society of Anesthesiologists' I and II adult patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery under subarachnoid block were randomized to receive either 3 ml 0.5% isobaric ropivacaine and 25 mcg fentanyl (Group R) or 3 ml 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine and 25 mcg fentanyl (Group B). The hemodynamic profiles, maximum upper level of sensory block height, time to reach peak block height, two dermatome regression time, and duration of motor block were recorded. There was no statistically significant difference regarding the hemodynamic parameters between the groups. The median (range) peak sensory block height was T7 (T4-T9) in Group R and T7 (T4-T10) in Group B. Time to reach peak block height (13.2 +- 2.3 min in Group R vs. 13.7 +- 2.2 min in Group B; P = 0.385) was similar between the groups. Two dermatome regression time in sensory block (median 120 min vs. 85 min; P < 0.001) and duration of motor block (median 245 min vs. 150 min; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in Group B. The duration of analgesia (median 360 min vs. 245 min; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in the bupivacaine group. Intrathecal isobaric bupivacaine-fentanyl combination produces a significantly longer duration of analgesia, sensory block and motor block than isobaric ropivacaine-fentanyl combination. As ropivacaine has a shorter duration of sensory and motor block, it may be preferred in day care surgery. K8VOwiqm@fudan.edu.cn\n",

The research methodology and the application of statistical tools and techniques have evolved over the years and have significantly helped the research activities throughout the globe. The results and inferences are not accurately possible without proper validation with various statistical tools and tests. The evidencebased anesthesia research and practice has to incorporate statistical tools in the methodology right from the planning stage of the study itself. Though the medical fraternity is well acquainted with the significance of statistics in research, there is a lack of in-depth knowledge about the various statistical concepts and principles among majority of the researchers. The clinical impact and consequences can be serious as the incorrect analysis, conclusions, and false results may construct an artificial platform on which future research activities are replicated.

Acute pain services were conceived three decades ago to form a dedicated team to monitor pain assessment and treatment as per laid down pain protocols and guidelines. The concept of acute pain service (APS) is slowly evolving in India. This nationwide questionnaire survey was conducted to identify the status of postoperative pain, the prevalent treatment practices, and the prevalence of acute pain services in India. An electronic communication was sent to 4000 Indian Society of Anesthesiologists life members. We received only 146 responses mainly from faculties/consultants from few corporate hospitals or medical colleges. About 68 APSs were functioning, however, 20 APS do not have any training programs and 34 have no written protocols. Anesthesiologists were involved in postoperative pain management only when epidural analgesia was employed. This survey found that majority of anesthesiologists agree to establish an APS, however administrative issues seem to be a major barrier. fuOBkdJD@fudan.edu.cn\n",

      "CYP11A1, a gene belonging to the family 11 of cytochrome P450, encodes a crucial steroidogenic enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in the production of all classes of steroids. Many studies show that CYP11A1 plays a role in ovary function. However, the role of CYP11A1 in goose reproductive cycle remains largely unknown. In this study, full-length CYP11A1 cDNA of Zhedong goose was obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA consisted of a 96-base pair (bp) 5'untranslated region (UTR), a 179-bp 3'UTR and a 1509-bp open reading frame. The open reading frame encodes a putative 503 amino acid protein that shares high homology with CYP11A1 of other birds. The amino acid sequence possesses conserved domains of the P450 superfamily, which include the steroid-binding domain and the heme-binding region. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed CYP11A1 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously in every Zhedong goose tissue analyzed, including the heart, liver, glandular stomach, lung, spleen, kidney, intestinum tenue, intestinum crassum, cerebrum, cerebellum, muscle, oviduct, pituitary, hypothalamus and ovary.. The relatively low levels of CYP11A1 mRNA were detected in pituitary, ovary and oviduct tissues at ovulation when compared with levels at oviposition. Interestingly, higher expression was observed in ovary and oviduct tissues during brooding. Lastly, higher mRNA expression of Yangzhou geese was detected during the ovulation period than that of Zhedong geese. Our findings reveal the sequence characterization and expression patterns of the CYP11A1 gene during the goose reproductive cycle, which may provides correlative evidence that CYP11A1 expression is important in reproduction activity. +86-8610498172\n",

      "Identification of genetic variants, including SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), CNVs (Copy Number Variations) and alternative splicing, within functional genes has received increasing attention in animal science research. HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor) is a very important growth factor that works as a mitogen or a morphogen during tissue growth, development and regeneration. However, to date, the functions of genetic variants within the bovine HGF gene, particularly their effects on mRNA expression, have not been determined well. The present study aimed to perform association analysis between genetic variants and mRNA expression for the bovine HGF gene in Qinchuan cattle using various strategies, including PCR-RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), qPCR (Quantitative Real-time quantitative PCR), TA cloning, DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. A total of five SNPs were identified and only SV1 locus significantly affected HGF mRNA expression in fetal skeletal muscle (P < 0.05). Heterozygous genotype individuals showed significantly higher HGF expression (P < 0.05), which was significantly greater in the \"\"CTCCAGGGTT\"\" combined genotype than that in the \"\"CCCCGGGGTT\"\" combined genotype (P < 0.05). In addition, two alternative splicing variations, HGF-W and HGF-M, were identified, which resulted from alternative 3' splice sites of exon 5, and HGF-W showed higher mRNA levels than HGF-M in all tissues. In summary, genetic variations within the HGF gene affected mRNA expression. These findings provide new insight into the molecular characteristics and functions of bovine HGF. 5lHn6E@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

In \"\"real-world\"\" practice, however, NOAC adherence and persistence among patients are not clear. The aim of this study is to evaluate NOAC and warfarin persistence in Japanese patients with NVAF who newly started these drugs. We retrospectively studied 401 patients with NVAF who had newly started NOACs during the first 18 months after our hospital adopted their use (197 dabigatran, 107 rivaroxaban, 102 apixaban) and 200 patients with NVAF who had newly started warfarin during the same period. The endpoint was drug discontinuation for each drug. During the follow-up period (up to a maximum of 24 months), 113 (28%) patients who had newly started NOACs and 33 (17%) patients who had newly started warfarin discontinued the drug. The persistence rates of patients prescribed NOACs was lower than that of patients prescribed warfarin at 3, 6, and 12 months (85% versus 93%, 79% versus 88%, and 70% versus 82%, respectively). One-tenth of patients who had newly started NOACs discontinued the drug by their own decision. Drug adverse events, worsening renal dysfunction, and patient desire were the major causes of NOAC discontinuation. The rate of persistence of prescribed NOACs was significantly lower than that of warfarin in Japanese patients with NVAF. XH6x30@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

      "Lead V1 on electrocardiography (ECG) can detect the dominant frequency (DF) of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the right atrium (RA). Paroxysmal AF is characterized by a frequency gradient from the left atrium (LA) to the right atrium (RA). We examined the ability of magnetocardiography (MCG) to detect regional DFs in both the atria. Study subjects comprised 18 consecutive patients referred for catheter ablation of persistent AF. An MCG system with 64 magnetic sensors was used to perform MCG in the frontal, lateral, and back planes prior to the ablation procedure in each patient. DFMCG and organization index (OIMCG) were calculated using fast Fourier transformation. Intracardiac electrograms (ICEs) in both the atria and the coronary sinus (CS) were mapped at 17 sites. Regional DFsICE were also determined. Mean LA DFICE was higher than mean RA DFICE (6.40+-0.66 versus 6.16+-0.80 Hz, P=0.03). DFMCG in the channel having the highest OIMCG was 6.61+-0.88 Hz in the frontal plane, 6.52+-0.64 Hz in the lateral plane, and 6.42+-0.62 Hz in the back plane (P=0.3). In each plane, DFMCG correlated with DFICE at the RA appendage (R=0.95, P<0.0001), the LA appendage (R=0.91, P<0.0001), and the CS (R=0.93, P<0.0001). DFECG in V5 modestly correlated with DFICE at the LA appendage (R=0.82, P<0.0001). MCG could more precisely detect the DFs in the LA and the CS than ECG. However, the usefulness of pre-procedural detection of the AF frequency gradient for ablation therapy needs to be evaluated in future prospective studies. qGlO@163.com\n",

      "Because obesity is an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), we conducted an animal study to examine the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) on atrial properties and AF inducibility. Ten 8-week-old pigs (weight, 18-23 kg) were divided into two groups. For 18 weeks, five pigs were fed a HFD (HFD group) and five were fed a normal diet (control group). Maps of atrial activation and voltages during sinus rhythm were created for all pigs using the EnSite NavX system. Effective refractory period (ERP) and AF inducibility were also determined. When AF was induced, complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) mapping was performed. At 18 weeks, hearts were removed for comparing the results of histological analysis between the two groups. Body weight, lipid levels, hemodynamics, cardiac structures, and electrophysiological properties were also compared. Total cholesterol levels were significantly higher (347 [191-434] vs. 81 [67-88] mg/dL, P=0.0088), and left atrium pressure was higher (34.5 [25.6-39.5] vs. 24.5 [21.3-27.8] mmHg, P=0.0833) in the HFD group than in the control group, although body weight only increased marginally (89 [78-101] vs. 70 [66-91] kg, P=0.3472). ERPs of the pulmonary vein (PV) were shorter (P<0.05) and AF lasted longer in the HFD group than in the control group (80 [45-1350] vs. 22 [3-30] s, P=0.0212). Neither CFAE site distribution nor histopathological characteristics differed between the two groups. The shorter ERPs for the PV observed in response to the HFD increased vulnerability to AF, and these electrophysiological characteristics may underlie obesity-related AF. on6q@126.com\n",

      "Left atrial flutter following atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is increasingly common and difficult to treat. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ablation of the anteroseptal line connecting the right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) to the anteroseptal mitral annulus (MA) for the treatment of perimitral flutter (PMF). We systematically studied patients who were previously treated with AF ablation and who presented to the electrophysiology laboratory with atrial tachyarrhythmias between January 2000 and July 2010. The diagnosis of PMF was confirmed by activation mapping and/or entrainment. After re-isolation of any recovered pulmonary vein, a linear radiofrequency (RF) ablation was performed on the line that connected the RSPV to the anteroseptal MA. In this analysis, we included only patients who were treated with an anteroseptal line for their PMF. Ablation was performed at the anteroseptal line in 27 PMF patients (63+-13 years; 9 women) who had undergone prior ablation for paroxysmal (n=3) or persistent (n=24) AF, using electroanatomic activation mapping (70% CARTO, 30% NavX). The anteroseptal ablation line was effective in 22/27 (81.5%) patients in the acute-care setting. Termination of AF to sinus rhythm occurred in 15/22 (68.2%) patients, and 7/22 (31.8%) patients' AF converted to another right or left atrial flutter. At the 6-month follow-up, 20% of patients demonstrated recurrent left atrial tachyarrhythmia. Only one patient required repeat ablation, and the remaining patients' condition was controlled with antiarrhythmic medications. No major procedural complications or heart block occurred. Ablation at the left atrial anteroseptal line is safe and efficacious for the treatment of PMF. Unlike ablation at the traditional mitral isthmus line, ablation at the left atrial anteroseptal line does not require ablation in the coronary sinus. BHsvMTWL@126.com\n",

The goal of this study was to determine whether Purkinje potential (PP) pacing could provide better hemodynamics in patients with left bundle branch block and heart failure than biventricular (BiV) pacing. Eleven patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or III heart failure despite optimal medical therapy were selected for this study. All patients underwent left- and right-sided cardiac catheterization for measurement of LV functional parameters in the control state during BiV and PP pacing. Maximum dP/dt increased during BiV and PP pacing when compared with control measurements. This study compared parameters measured during BiV pacing with PP pacing and non-paced beats as the control state in each patient (717+-171 mmHg/s vs. 917+-191 mmHg/s, p<0.05; and 921+-199 mmHg/s, p<0.005); however, the difference between PP pacing and BiV pacing was not significant.

Digital analysis of retrospectively recorded 12-lead electrocardiograms was performed to select patients with a biphasic P wave (positive/negative) in lead II from a database of 114,334 patients. Characteristics of the P wave in the inferior leads associated with incidence of AF were determined. Receiver operating characteristic curves dichotomized P wave variables were measured in each lead. A total of 141 patients (77 men; mean age, 64+-19 years) were enrolled in this study. Twenty-nine (20.6%) patients developed AF (AF group) vs. 112 (79.6%) who did not (non-AF group) during a follow-up period of 50+-62 months. The amplitude of the initial P wave portion in lead II was significantly larger in the AF group when compared with the non-AF group (77.3+-77.0 uV vs. 51.0+-30.1 uV, p=0.003), while the amplitude of the terminal P wave portion in lead III was significantly decreased in the AF group when compared with the non-AF group (-70.6+-41.3 uV vs. -89.1+-38.1 uV, p=0.024). The duration of the initial P wave portion in lead III was significantly longer in the AF group when compared with the non-AF group (52.7+-34.6 ms vs. 35.8+-30.4 ms, p=0.011). Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis confirmed that the increased duration of the initial P wave portion in lead III (>=71 ms) was independently associated with AF development (hazard ratio 2.90, 95% confidence interval 1.16-7.11, p=0.02). The analyses of the biphasic P wave in the inferior leads suggest that the development of AF could be attributed to increased atrial slow conduction. khwScK5@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

Although adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is known to promote AF by shortening the atrial refractory period, its role in the pathogenesis of CFAEs and DF during AF is not fully understood. We recorded electrical activity from a 64-electrode basket catheter placed in the left atrium (LA) of patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF, n=18) or persistent AF (PerAF, n=19) before ablation. Atrial electrogram fractionation intervals (FIs) and DFs were measured from bipolar electrograms of each adjacent electrode pair. Offline mean atrial FIs and DFs were obtained before bolus injection of 30 mg ATP. Peak effect was defined as an R-R interval >3 s. With ATP, the mean FI decreased (from 110.4+-29.1 ms to 90.5+-24.7 ms, P<0.0001) and DF increased (from 6.4+-0.6 Hz to 7.1+-0.8 Hz, P<0.0001) in all patients.

ATP shortens atrial FIs and increases DFs in both PAF and PerAF patients.

During an electrophysiological study, NSVTs reproducibly recurred only after right ventricular (RV) pacing; LV pacing did not induce any NSVTs. The activation map was consistent with a localized reentry at the interventricular septum, and a double exit; at the LV exit site, a single radiofrequency energy application immediately interrupted the occurrence of the NSVTs.

Isopimaric acid is synthesized using geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a precursor molecule that is cyclized by a diterpene synthase in the chloroplast and subsequently oxidized by a cytochrome P450, CYP720B4. We transiently expressed the isopimaric acid pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and enhanced its productivity by the expression of two rate-limiting steps in the pathway (providing the general precursor of diterpenes). This co-expression resulted in 3-fold increase in the accumulation of both isopimaradiene and isopimaric acid detected using GC-MS and LC-MS methodology. We also showed that modifying or deleting the transmembrane helix of CYP720B4 does not alter the enzyme activity and led to successful accumulation of isopimaric acid in the infiltrated leaves. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a modified membrane anchor is a prerequisite for a functional CYP720B4 enzyme when the chloroplast targeting peptide is added. We report the accumulation of 45-55 mg/g plant dry weight of isopimaric acid four days after the infiltration with the modified enzymes. It is possible to localize a diterpenoid pathway from spruce fully within the chloroplast of N. benthamiana and a few modifications of the N-terminal sequences of the CYP720B4 can facilitate the expression of plant P450s in the plastids. The coupling of terpene biosynthesis closer to photosynthesis paves the way for light-driven biosynthesis of valuable terpenoids. 17285914675\n",

      "Epigenetic deregulation is a common feature in the pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-related lymphomas and carcinomas. Previous studies have demonstrated a strong association between EBV latency in B-cells and epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressor gene BIM. This study aimed to the construction and functional analysis of the BIM interactome in order to identify novel host genes that may be targeted by EBV. Fifty-nine unique interactors were found to compose the BIM gene network. Ontological analysis at the pathway level highlighted infectious diseases along with neuropathologies. These results underline the possible interplay between the BIM interactome and EBV-associated disorders. 1162584807\n",

      "The aim of this study was to measure the haemodynamic responses to a etomidate-propofol combination used for anaesthesia induction and to compare the haemodynamic responses with the separate use of each drug. The patients were randomly divided into three groups as group P (n = 30, propofol 2.5 mg kg(-1)), group E (n = 30, etomidate 0.3 mg kg(-1)) and group PE (n = 30, propofol 1.25 mg kg(-1) + etomidate 0.15 mg kg(-1)). For each patient, the times of measurement of the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure values were defined as baseline, after the induction, before the intubation, immediately after the intubation and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 minutes after the intubation. In all 3 groups, a significant decrease in MAP values were seen at T2 and T3 compared to the baseline values, and this decrease was greater in group P compared to that in group E and PE (P < 0.001, P < 0.01). A significant increase was seen in all 3 groups in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) value at T4 after the intubation. When the groups were compared with each other, this increase was greater in group E than in the other two groups (with group P, P < 0.001; with group PE, P < 0.01). Etomidate-propofol combination may be a valuable alternative when extremes of hypotensive and hypertensive responses due to propofol and etomidate are best to be avoided. +86-2991085848\n",

      "Postoperative pain-management with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs has been controversial, due to related side-effects. We investigated whether there was a significant difference between an oxycodone-based pain-management regimen versus a slow-release ibuprofen based regimen, in a short term post-cardiac surgery setting. Particular attention was given to the rate of myocardial infarction, sternal healing, gastro-intestinal complications, renal failure and all-cause mortality. This was a single-centre, open label parallel design randomised controlled study. Patients, who were undergoing cardiac surgery for the first time, were randomly allocated either to a regimen of slow-release oxycodone (10 mg twice daily) or slow-release ibuprofen (800 mg twice daily) combined with lansoprazole. Data relating to blood-tests, angiographies, surgical details and administered medicine were obtained from patient records. The follow-up period was 1 to 37 months (median 25 months). One hundred eighty-two patients were included in the trial and available for intention to treat analysis. There were no significant difference between the groups (P>0.05) in the rates of sternal healing, postoperative myocardial infarction or gastrointestinal bleeding. The preoperative levels of creatinine were found to increase by 100% in nine patients (9.6%) in the ibuprofen group, resulting in an acute renal injury (in accordance with the RIFLE-criteria). Eight of these patients returned to normal renal function within 14 days. The levels of creatinine in patients in the oxycodone group were not found to increase to the same magnitude. The results of this study suggest that patients treated postoperatively, following cardiac surgery, are at no greater risk of harm if short term slow release ibuprofen combined with lansoprazole treatment is used when compared to an oxycodone based regimen. Renal function should, however, be closely monitored and in the event of any decrease in renal function ibuprofen must be discontinued. 16R2cZ9u@163.com\n",

      "The previous studies have suggested that alteration in oxidative stress and antioxidant defense depends on various factors, such as mode, intensity, frequency and duration of exercise. In this study, we compared the effects of two various durations of resistance exercise (1 month and 4 month) on oxidative stress and antioxidant status in cardiac tissue. Thirty Wistar male rats divided into 3 groups: control (sedentary), exercise-1 (regular exercise for 1 month) and exercise-2 group (regular exercise for 4 months). After the final to the experiment, the rats were anesthetized, and then blood and heart samples were obtained and used to determine glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and biochemical estimation. MDA levels between control and exercise-2 groups showed no significant difference, hence, MDA level in exercise-1 group was higher compared to control group (P < .01). The heart GPX activity increased significantly in exercise-2 group regarding other groups (P < .01). The SOD activities of groups were similar. Creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations increased in the exercise-1 compared to the other groups (P < .01). Our results indicate that in heart, the adaptation and alteration in oxidative stress and cell injury level depend on duration of exercise. F4iMFur@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the P wave axis in electrocardiogram (ECG), left atrial function and association between the disease activity score in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Standard 12-lead surface ECGs were recorded by at a paper speed of 25 m/s and an amplifier gain of 10 mm/mV. The heart rate (HR), the duration of PR, QRS, QTd (dispersion), the axis of P wave were measured by ECG machine automatically. The P wave axis was significantly increased in patients with SLE (49 +- 20 vs. 40 +- 18, P = 0.037) and the disease activity score was found positively correlated with P wave axis (r: 0.382, P = 0.011). The LA volume and the peak systolic strain of the left atrium (LA) were statistically different between the groups (P = 0.024 and P = 0.000). The parameters of the diastolic function; E/A and E/e' were better in the control group than the patients with SLE (1.1 +- 0.3 vs. 1.3 +- 0.3, P = 0.041 and 6.6 +- 2.8 vs. 5.4 +- 1.4, P = 0.036, respectively). P wave axis was found significantly increased in patients with SLE and positively correlated with SELENA-SLEDAI score. As the risk score increases in patients with SLE, P wave axis changes which may predict the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. klp7@163.com\n",

MS tracks into adulthood increasing the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to verify the rate of MS in elementary school students of Birjand, as a representative sample of Iranian children to verify the best preventive measures in this age group. This descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional study was performed on 1425 elementary school children through multiple-cluster sampling in 2013. Height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure of children were measured by standard methods. Blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were also measured after 12 hours fasting. MS was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) based on the National Cholesterol Education Program. Data were analyzed by SPSS using t test and chi-square test. Significance level was set at P < 0.05. The prevalence of MS was 5.3% which increased with age. 43.5% of the studied cases had one or more components of the MS. The most common components were hypertension, abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol and impaired fasting glucose, respectively. MS prevalence was 0.9% in normal weight, 11.3% in overweight and 36.2% in obese children. Regarding the high prevalence of MS in elementary school children in our region, screening for obesity is recommended to prevent adulthood complications. Therapeutic lifestyle changes and maintenance of regular physical activity are the most important strategies for preventing childhood obesity. 5ENd@fudan.edu.cn\n",

However the global burden of IHD has been concentrated on developing countries, where limited research efforts have been made to address these needs. This study aimed to understand the global distribution of IHD research activities by looking at the countries' burden of disease, income and development data. As a scientometric study, Scopus database was searched for research publications indexed under the medical subject heading (MeSH) 'myocardial ischemia' including the following terms: coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, and ischemic heart disease. The number of research publications in Scopus database was recorded for each individual year 2000-2012, and for each country. Data for estimated IHD disability-adjusted life-year's (DALY's), gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and human development index were also included for the analysis. IHD research publications were most likely produced by European and Western pacific countries. High-income countries produced the greatest share of about 81% of the global IHD research. However, no significant association observed between the countries' GDP and number of research publications worldwide (OR = 0.98, P = 0.939). Global IHD research found to be strongly associated with the burden of disease (P < 0.0001) and the countries' HDI values worldwide (OR = 16.8, P = 0.016). Our study suggested that global research on IHD were geographically distributed and highly concentrated among the world's richest countries.

This study up aims to describe the prevalence, clinical profile and associated cardiac anomaly of children diagnosed with TOF documented over an eight year period in a tertiary hospital in South Western Nigeria. A prospective review of all consecutive cases of TOF diagnosed with echocardiography at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) between January 2007 and December 2014. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Tables and charts were used to depict those variables. Descriptive statistic are presented as percentages or means and standard deviation. Means of normally distributed variables were compared using the student t test and proportions using chi-square test. Skewed distribution were analyzed using appropriate non-parametric tests. Level of significance set at P < 0.05. The prevalence of TOF among children presenting at LASUTH at the study period was 4.9 per 10 000 while its prevalence among those with congenital heart disease was 16.9%. There was a male predominance and most children presented within 1-5 years of age. Chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, Turners syndrome and CATCH 22 syndrome were documented in some subjects. Some of the subjects had atypical presentation. TOF is as common in Nigeria as other parts of the world, there is a need to established cardiac centers to salvage these children.

Afyonkarahisar located at the intersection of roads and phytogeographical regions (Mediterranean, Iran-Turan, and Euro-Siberian) has more than 2500 plant species. This richness of plant diversity promotes the indigenous commuity for the traditional use of wild plants. The aim of the study is to show wild plants' ethnobotanical usages associated with medicinal, food, fodder, and household goods in 31 settlements within the boundaries of Afyonkarahisar province. The ethnobotanical data were collected from 46 informants by means of semi-structured interviews from 2012 to 2014. Ethnobotanical uses of plants of the study area were conducted in the vicinity of Afyonkarahisar (5 districts, 8 towns, 15 villages, and 3 neighborhood centers). One hundred and thirty plant taxa belonging to 39 families were recorded and collected. Hundred and seventy-eight different uses of these plants were documented and used generally for medicinal (84), food (68), fodder (16), household goods (3), dyes (3), handicrafts (3) and religious (1). This study provides interesting uses of plants in the local community of Afyonkarahisar and its surrounding area, in what purpose they make use of plants, how they make use of them and obtained results will contribute to economy of villagers. Since the local people, especially in villages, are poor and do not have health care, they use the plants to treat illnesses, food, fodder, household goods and other uses (evil eye). Also this study will light the way for posterity for next generations. 11133481671\n",

      "Some grass species are richer in coumarin and thus more sweetly scented than others. These have been eagerly sought after in parts of Norway, but the tradition has been weakly documented, both in terms of the species collected, their vernacular names, and uses. Based on literature data and a substantial body of information collected during my own ethnobotanical field work, artefacts and voucher specimens, the grass species are identified, and their uses clarified. In Norwegian literature, the tradition of collecting and using scented grasses has received little attention, and past authors largely refer it to Anthoxanthum spp. The tradition's concentration to the Sami strongholds of northernmost Norway, and most authors' lacking knowledge of the Sami language, have contributed to the weak and misleading coverage in previous publications. Coumarin-rich grass species are well known in folk tradition in northernmost Norway, as luktegress (Norwegian, \"\"scent grass\"\"), haissasuoidni (North Sami, \"\"scent grass\"\"), hajuheina (Finnish, \"\"scent grass\"\"), or similar terms. They have been (and still are) frequently collected, and used as perfume, for storing with clothes, and a number of other purposes. Despite literature records identifying the species used as Anthoxanthum odoratum coll. (including A. nipponicum), the main source utilized in North Norway is Hierochloe odorata, both ssp. arctica and ssp. odorata. Anthoxanthum nipponicum and Milium effusum are alternative, but infrequently used sources of material, depending on local tradition and availability. By far the most important grass species hiding behind the \"\"scented grass\"\" tradition in Norway is Hierochloe odorata. Anthoxanthum nipponicum is also used, but much less frequently, and only a single record confirms the use of Milium effusum. Only the foliage of Hierochloe provides suitable material for making traditional braids. The three major ethnic groups in Norway have all utilized scented grasses as perfume and for storing with clothes, but the tradition's geographical concentration to the far north of Norway (Finnmark and NE Troms), suggests that it has originally mainly been a Sami tradition, adopted by their neighbours. +86-2466152440\n",

      "The goal of this project was to use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as the theoretical foundation for developing a web-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary care screening and care coordination by dental hygienists at chairside. First, we appraised New York State education and scope of practice requirements for dental hygienists with input from health experts who constituted a Senior Advisory Board for the project, and reviewed current professional guidelines and best practices for tobacco use, hypertension and diabetes screening, and nutrition counseling at chairside. Second, we created algorithms for these four health issues (tobacco, hypertension, diabetes, and nutrition) using evidence-based guidelines endorsed by authoritative professional bodies. Third, an information technology specialist incorporated the algorithms into a tool using an iterative process to refine the CDSS, with input from dental hygienists, dentists, Senior Advisory Board members and research staff. An evidence-based CDSS for use by dental hygienists at chairside for tobacco use, hypertension and diabetes screening, and nutrition counseling was developed with the active participation of the individuals involved in the implementation process. CDSS technology may potentially be leveraged to enhance primary care screening and coordination by dental hygienists at chairside, leading to improved patient care. Using the CFIR as a pragmatic structure for implementing this intervention across multiple settings, the developed CDSS is available for downloading and adaptation to diverse dental settings and other primary care sensitive conditions.

      "Determination of a patient's volume status remains challenging. Ultrasound assessments of the inferior vena cava and lung parenchyma have been shown to reflect fluid status when compared to the more traditional static and dynamic methods. Yet, resource-limited intensive care units (ICUs) may still not have access to bedside ultrasound. The vascular pedicle width (VPW) measured on chest radiographs remains underutilized for fluid assessment. In this study, we aimed to determine the correlation between ultrasound assessment and vascular pedicle width and to identify a discriminant value that predicted a fluid replete state. Eighty-four data points of simultaneous VPW and inferior vena cava measurements were collected on mechanically ventilated patients. VPW measurements were compared with lung comet scores, fluid balance, and a composite variable of inferior vena cava diameter greater than or equal to 2 cm and variability less than 15 %. A VPW of 64 mm accurately predicted fluid repletion with a positive predictive value equal to 88.5 % and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.843, 95 % CI 0.75-0.93, p < 0.001. VPW closely correlated with inferior vena cava diameter (Pearson's r = 0.64, p = <0.001). Poor correlations were observed between VPW and lung comet score, Pearson's r = 0.12, p = 0.26, fluid balance, Pearson's r = 0.3, p = 0.058, and beta natriuretic peptide, Pearson's r = 0.12, p = 0.26. This study shows a high predictive ability of the VPW for fluid repletion, as compared to an accepted method of volume assessment. Given the relationship of fluid overload and mortality, these results may assist fluid resuscitation in resource-limited intensive care units. 1990210847\n",

      "An edge-enhancement technique using an interval type II fuzzy set that uses rank-ordered filter to enhance the edges of cellular images is proposed. When cellular images from any laboratory are digitized, scanned, and stored, some kind of degradation occurs, and directly using a rank-ordered filter may not produce clear edges. These images contain uncertainties, present in edges or boundaries of the image. Fuzzy sets that take into account these uncertainties may be a good tool to process these images. However, a fuzzy set sometimes does not produce better results. We used an interval type II fuzzy set, which considers the uncertainty in a different way. It considers the membership function in the fuzzy set as \"\"fuzzy,\"\" so the membership values lie within an interval range. A type II fuzzy set has upper and lower membership levels, and with the two levels, a new membership function is computed using Hamacher t-conorm. A new fuzzy image is formed. A rank-ordered filter is applied to the image to obtain an edge-enhanced image. The proposed method is compared with the existing methods visually and quantitatively using entropic method. Entropy of the proposed method is higher (0.4418) than the morphology method (0.2275), crisp method (0.3599), and Sobel method (0.2669), implying that the proposed method is better.

These measures were acquired in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) at the umbilical level of 21 healthy adult subjects. A moderate correlation exists between MRI- and CT-derived WAT values for all subjects, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], with a slope of [Formula: see text], (95% CI [Formula: see text]), indicating that a decrease of 1 HU equals a mean increase of 0.38% FSF.

The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to study the efficacy of emergent surgical pericardiotomy in both the relief of cardiac tamponade and in the prevention of recurrence of pericardial effusion. This study involved 90 consecutive patients (58 males and 32 females) with a mean age of 57.4 +- 14.1 years, who underwent emergent pericardiotomy in the years 2006 to 2011 due to symptomatic primary cardiac tamponade. At the end of the follow-up period all living subjects had control echocardiographic examination. Survival analysis was performed with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The mean duration time of surgery was 14.2 +- 4.5 minutes. All patients survived surgery but one died during in-hospital stay. During the post-discharge follow-up period (median 49 months) 32 patients died for any reason. One-year and four-year probability of survival was 0.68 +- 0.05 and 0.64 +- 0.05, respectively.

In order to save patients' lives they are treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT). The aim of our study was to assess the impact of different perioperative factors on mortality among patients treated with RRT because of acute renal failure, which occurred as a complication of a heart surgery. Retrospective analysis included 45 patients, operated in the years 2009-2013, who underwent renal replacement therapy in order to treat postoperative ARF. The perioperative factors were analysed in two groups: group 1 - patients who died before discharge; and group 2 - those who survived until hospital discharge. Forty-five of 3509 cardiac surgical patients (1.25%) required RRT after the surgery. A total of 23 (51.11%) died before discharge (group 1). Patients in group 1 were characterised by older age (70.21 vs. 67 years), higher mean EuroSCORE value (9.28 vs. 7.15) (p < 0.05), higher percentage of concomitant surgery (63.63% vs. 28.57%) (p < 0.05) and of admission of catecholamines in the postoperative period (100% vs. 68.42%) (p < 0.005), and higher mean urea blood level prior to RRT initiation (156.65 vs. 102.54 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). The statistically relevant death predictors proved to be: high EuroSCORE, concomitant surgery, and high urea level at RRT initiation and admission of catecholamines in the postoperative period.

      "Approximately 60 000 prosthetic valves are implanted annually in the USA. The risk of prosthesis dysfunction ranges from 0.1% to 4% per year. Prosthesis valve dysfunction is usually caused by a thrombus obstructing the prosthetic discs. However, 10% of prosthetic valves are dysfunctional due to pannus formation, and 12% of prostheses are damaged by both fibrinous and thrombotic components. The authors present two patients with dysfunctional aortic prostheses who were referred for cardiac surgery. Different surgical solutions were used in the treatment of each case. The first patient was a 71-year-old woman whose medical history included arterial hypertension, stable coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypercholesterolemia; she had previously undergone left-sided mastectomy and radiotherapy. The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Department due to aortic prosthesis dysfunction. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed complete obstruction of one disc and a severe reduction in the mobility of the second. The mean transvalvular gradient was very high. During the operation, pannus covering the discs' surface was found. A biological aortic prosthesis was reimplanted without complications. The second patient was an 87-year-old woman with arterial hypertension, persistent atrial fibrillation, and COPD, whose past medical history included gastric ulcer disease and ischemic stroke. As in the case of the first patient, she was admitted due to valvular prosthesis dysfunction. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed an obstruction of the posterior prosthetic disc and significant aortic regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy confirmed the prosthetic dysfunction. During the operation, a thrombus growing around a minor pannus was found. The thrombus and pannus were removed, and normal functionality of the prosthetic valve was restored. Precise and modern diagnostic methods facilitated selection of the treatment method. However, the intraoperative view also seems to be crucial in individualizing the surgical approach. GVOu@fudan.edu.cn\n",

A special group is constituted by children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome because their treatment is extremely complex, requiring three-stage surgery and the involvement of various specialists. We analysed 100 infants with congenital heart defects in the form of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). They were compared with a control group of 100 newborns without structural heart defects. The children's parents were asked to fill out a questionnaire consisting of 10 simple questions. It had been constructed in consultation with a psychologist in order not to offend the feelings of the parents affected by the illness of their offspring. Congenital heart defects were present in the family medical histories of 16 HLHS children and 11 healthy children (p = 0.4). Genetic disorders were present in the family medical histories of 13 HLHS children and 15 healthy children (p = 0.73). In the HLHS group, the mothers smoked cigarettes or were exposed to tobacco smoke in 32% of cases; in the control group, this proportion amounted to 23% (p = 0.76).

      "Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura (SFTP) are primary tumors arising from mesenchymal cells. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that the origin of these tumors is mesenchymal rather than mesothelial. The aim of this study is to present our experience with diagnosing and treating patients with SFTP. We analyzed 18 patients treated at the Department of Thoracic Surgery of the Medical University of Lodz. The patients' medical histories and the results of postoperative histopathological investigation of the tumors were analyzed. Postoperative histopathological samples were evaluated with regard to the current criteria of malignancy. In 17 patients, the tumors were surgically removed. Benign and small lesions (less than 3 cm in size) were removed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). In 5 cases, malignant tumors were found in the postoperative material. Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura is a tumor with frequently asymptomatic clinical course. Treatment consists in resection which includes the adjacent structures, especially if the tumor is malignant. LiTBWu@qq.com\n",

      "The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system is a main element of the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure (CHF), determining its symptoms and prognosis. Vitamin D is an RAA inhibitor, and its deficiency frequently accompanies CHF. The factors determining the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in CHF are not well understood, although an association has been suggested between the deficiency and the advancement of CHF. Also unknown is the influence of therapeutic escalation using recommended agents on the serum level of 25(OH)D. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of abnormal 25(OH)D concentrations in CHF patients and to establish the clinical and laboratory determinants of low activity of this metabolite. The retrospective analysis included the data of 412 CHF patients not receiving optimal pharmacological treatment who were initially in NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III or IV. Over the period of 3 months the therapy was escalated until reaching maximum tolerated doses or those recommended by the current guidelines. After optimizing the therapy, the incidence of 25(OH)D deficiency (< 30 ng/ml) and insufficiency (< 20 ng/ml) was established, and clinical and laboratory determinants for these abnormal concentrations were analyzed. Normal serum level, insufficiency, and deficiency of 25(OH)D were observed in, respectively, 41.5%, 26.0% and 32.5% of patients. The NYHA class improved by at least 1 class in 63.6% of patients, remained unchanged in 32.8% of patients, and deteriorated in 3.6% of patients. In multivariables analysis, low availability of natural ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, loss of body mass during the CHF, higher concentrations of phosphates and albumins, and the presence of diabetes increased the risk of 25(OH)D deficiency, while higher concentrations of uric acid reduced this risk. In patients with a positive response to therapy, the concentration of 25(OH)D was borderline significantly higher (p = 0.055), while insufficiency and deficiency were less frequent (p = 0.02) than in patients without a treatment response, but this pertained only to patients with higher exposure to UVB. These differences were not observed in patients with low UVB exposure. The concentration of 25(OH)D in CHF patients is not associated with the advancement of the disease, but is strongly determined by the potential availability of UVB radiation. A positive response to therapy increases the concentration of 25(OH)D only in the case of high UVB exposure; other determinants of 25(OH)D level include the patient's metabolic profile and the presence of diabetes. 11145830846\n",

      "Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a recognised method of treatment for patients with end-stage chronic or acute heart failure. The POLCAS pulsatile-flow system has been used in our institution for 15 years. Currently, it is being widely replaced by continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support equipment of the second and third generations (HeartMateII, HeartWare). The MCS presented in this study is associated with a significant risk of complications and its use is increasingly considered controversial. The aim of the study was an evaluation of the results of treatment utilising the POLCAS MCS system at our institution in 2014. The POLCAS system was implanted in 12 patients aged 16-63 years (42 +- 17 years) during a period of 12 months (from January to December, 2014). Full-blown cardiogenic shock was observed in all patients before MCS implantation. Four of the analysed patients (33%) required prior circulatory support with other devices: IABP (n = 2) or ECMO (n = 2). Episodes of cardiac arrest were reported in three patients; three other patients experienced serious arrhythmias, which accelerated the decision to implant MCS. The presented data was retrospectively obtained from the CliniNET system of the Institute of Cardiology. OpenOffice Calc spreadsheet was used for data analysis. Average MCS time was 41 days +- 25 (from 15 to 91 days). Survival until transplantation or explantation was 91.67%. The most frequent complications following the therapy were: cardiac tamponade or bleeding requiring an intervention - 25% (n = 3), renal failure requiring dialysis - 25% (n = 3), ischaemic stroke associated with the MCS - 16.6% (n = 2), bacteraemia - 16.6% (n = 2), and wound infection - 8% (n = 1). No malfunctions of the MCS system were reported. Early survival in patients who completed the MCS therapy, defined as discharge, amounted to 63.6% (n = 7). The POLCAS heart assist system is an effective method of treatment as a bridge to transplantation or recovery in patients with end-stage heart failure. Early survival after the treatment remains at a satisfactory level. The main problem is the large number of complications related to the therapy. 1386401172\n",

      "Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is an umbrella term describing the various technologies used in both short- and long-term management of patients with either end-stage chronic heart failure (HF) or acute HF. Most often, MCS has emerged as a bridge to transplantation, but more recently it is also used as a destination therapy. Mechanical circulatory support includes left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or bi-ventricular assist device (Bi-VAD). Currently, 2- to 3-year survival in carefully selected patients is much better than with medical therapy. However, MCS therapy is hampered by sometimes life-threatening complications including bleeding and device thrombosis. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) has two major functions in haemostasis. First, it plays a crucial role in platelet-subendothelium adhesion and platelet-platelet interactions (aggregation). Second, it is the carrier of factor VIII (FVIII) in plasma. Von Willebrand factor prolongs FVIII half-time by protecting it from proteolytic degradation. It delivers FVIII to the site of vascular injury thus enhancing haemostatic process. On one hand, high plasma levels of vWF have been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. On the other, defects or deficiencies of vWF underlie the inherited von Willebrand disease or acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Here we review the pathophysiology of thrombosis and bleeding associated with vWF. ExXJ8@163.com\n",

Despite its several importance as a research model, as food, and in sport fishing, knowledge on transcriptome database is nil. Therefore, it was targeted to develop reference transcriptome databases of the species using next-generation sequencing. In the present study, 100,540,130 high-quality paired-end reads were obtained from six cDNA libraries of spleen, liver, gill, kidney, muscle, and brain with 28.4 GB data using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Tissue-specific transcriptomes as well as complete transcriptome assembly were analyzed for concise representation of the study. In brief, the de novo assembly of individual tissue resulted in an average of 31,829 (18,512-46,348) contigs per sample, while combined transcriptome comprised 77,907 unique transcript fragments (unigenes) assembled from reads of six tissues. Approximately 75,407 (96.8%) unigenes could be annotated according to their homology matches in the nr, SwisseProt, GO, or KEGG databases. Comparative analysis showed that 84% of the unigenes have significant similarity to zebra fish RefSeq proteins. Tissue-specific-dominated genes were also identified to hypothesize their localization and expression in individual tissue. In addition, 2485 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected from 77,907 transcripts in the combined transcriptome of the golden mahseer. This study has generated organ-specific transcriptome profiles, which will be helpful to understand the local adaptation, genome evolution, and also future functional studies on immune system of the golden mahseer.

      "There is a growing interest in the role of allelic variants of the APOA1 gene in relation to a number of disorders. We described two common polymorphisms of the APOA1 gene, G-75A and C+83T and investigated their potential influence on the serum apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) levels in the native population of Assam - a region that is ethnically distinct and from where no information is hitherto available. Blood samples were collected from 150 healthy volunteers. Apo A-I levels were estimated by immunoturbidometry. Genotyping was done by a PCR-RFLP method that involved DNA extraction from whole blood, followed by polymerase chain reaction and digestion of the PCR product by MspI restriction enzyme, and analysis of fragment sizes in 12% polyacrylamide gel. The GG variant at G-75A locus and CC variant at C+83T locus were the most prevalent. GG/CC was the most common combination. Homozygous TT genotype was not detected in any of the subjects. The rare allele frequencies for the G-75A and C+83T sites were found to be 0.22 and 0.06 respectively, which significantly differed from those reported in some other populations in neighbouring regions. Serum apo A-I concentrations did not vary significantly across the detected genotypes. These findings were consistent in both sexes. We described the distribution of the G-75A and C+83T polymorphisms of the APOA1 gene in the population of Assam for the first time. These polymorphisms were not found to directly influence apo A-I concentrations in this population either individually or synergistically. 1482425077\n",

Since post 9-11, U.S. military service members have been deployed in the global war on terrorism. This study attempted to determine the effectiveness of the FM 3-11 in detecting, deterring or preventing a human-borne with bioagent (HBBA) terrorist breach at an entry control point (ECP). This time-specific, cross-sectional study disseminated a validated survey tool with Cronbach's a > 0.82 to respondents who have had antiterrorism training and combat ECP experience. The return rate was greater than 75.0 %; however, many of the respondents failed to meet the inclusion criteria. Consequently, only 26 questionnaires were included in the sample. The results revealed that while over 60.0 % of the respondents either strongly agreed or agreed that biointelligence, the deployment of biodetectors and the use of biowarning systems could be effective in preventing an ECP breach by a terrorist with a bioagent, the use of protective equipment and immunization to decontaminate service members or other TTPs would never prevent a breach. A large percentage of respondents claimed that soldiers at the ECP lacked the devices or the knowledge to detect an HBBA at an ECP, and 72.0 % suggested modifying current ECP TTPs to include education, training and equipment for security personnel at military base ECPs. If obtained from appropriate sources and communicated to the personnel at the ECP in an effective or timely manner, the possible effectiveness of certain TTPs in the FM 3-11, specifically FM 3-11.86 (intelligence), might increase. e3Tl@qq.com\n",

      "Joint attention skills are impaired in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recently, varying degrees of autistic social attention deficit have been detected in the general population. We investigated gaze-triggered attention in individuals with high and low levels of autistic traits under visual-auditory cross-modal conditions, which are more sensitive to social attention deficits than unimodal paradigms. Sixty-six typically developing adults were divided into low- and high-autistic-trait groups according to scores on the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) questionnaire. We examined gaze-triggered attention under visual-auditory cross-modal conditions. Two sounds (a social voice and a non-social tone) were manipulated as targets to infer the relationship between the cue and the target. Two types of stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) conditions (a shorter 200-ms SOA and a longer 800-ms SOA) were used to directly test the effect of gaze cues on the detection of a sound target across different temporal intervals. Individuals with high autistic traits (high-AQ group) did not differ from those with low autistic traits (low-AQ group) with respect to gaze-triggered attention when voices or tones were used as targets under the shorter SOA condition. In contrast, under the longer SOA condition, gaze-triggered attention was not observed in response to tonal targets among individuals in the high-AQ group, whereas it was observed among individuals in the low-AQ group. The results demonstrated that cross-modal gaze-triggered attention is short-lived in individuals with high autistic traits. This finding provides insight into the cross-modal joint attention function among individuals along the autism spectrum from low autistic traits to ASD and may further our understanding of social behaviours among individuals at different places along the autistic trait continuum. r0xgx3P@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

      "Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease worldwide. Moreover, management of hypertension requires long-term treatment that may result in poor patient compliance with conventional dosage forms due to greater frequency of drug administration. Although there is availability of a plethora of therapeutically effective antihypertensive molecules, inadequate patient welfare is observed; this arguably presents an opportunity to deliver antihypertensive agents through a different route. Ever since the transdermal drug delivery came into existence, it has offered great advantages including non-invasiveness, prolonged therapeutic effect, reduced side effects, improved bioavailability, better patient compliance and easy termination of drug therapy. Attempts were made to develop the transdermal therapeutic system for various antihypertensive agents, including b-blockers, an important antihypertensive class. b-blockers are potent, highly effective in the management of hypertension and other heart ailments by blocking the effects of normal amounts of adrenaline in the heart and blood vessels. The shortcomings associated with b-blockers such as more frequent dose administration, extensive first pass metabolism and variable bioavailability, make them an ideal candidate for transdermal therapeutic systems. The present article gives a brief view of different b-blockers formulated as transdermal therapeutic system in detail to enhance the bioavailability as well as to improve patient compliance. Constant improvement in this field holds promise for the long-term success in technologically advanced transdermal dosage forms being commercialized sooner rather than later. hetBDZo@126.com\n",

In order to examine the efficacy and safety of such a combination therapy in T2DM patients finding inadequate control with metformin, this systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted. Literature search was made in multiple electronic databases. Inclusion criteria included; RCTs examining the efficacy and safety of DPPI-MET against placebo-MET or MET-only groups of T2DM patients by observing changes in disease endpoints including HbA1c and FPG, and the length of trial be at least 12 weeks. Mean differences based meta-analyses were performed and heterogeneity assessment was carried out. Nineteen studies were selected and included in the meta-analyses. DPPI-MET significantly improved all disease endpoints and the difference could be noticed up to 2 years in the majority of outcome measures. In comparison with PBO-MET, the DPPI-MET combinational therapy resulted in the percent HbA1c changes from baseline with a mean difference [95% CI] of -0.77 [-0.86, -0.69] in 3-month (P < 0.00001), -0.67 [-0.76, -0.59] in 6-month (P < 0.00001), -0.67 [-0.88, -0.47] in 1-year (P < 0.00001) and -0.36 [-0.53, -0.20] in 2-year trials (P < 0.0003).

Pharmacoeconomic studies in Saudi Arabia are scarce. The current hospital formulary contains 2 carbapenems: IC and MEM. These antibiotics share a similar spectrum of activity. There are conflicting reviews with regard to the relative cost-effectiveness of these two agents. A retrospective, single-centre cohort study of 88 patients of IC versus MEM in moderate to severe infections was performed, applying cost-minimization analysis (CMA) methods. In accordance with CMA methods, the assumption of equivalent efficacy was first demonstrated by literature retrieved and appraised. Adult patients (18 years old) diagnosed with moderate to severe infections, including skin and skin structure infections (SSIs), sepsis, intra-abdominal infections (IAIs), respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), who were prescribed IC 500 mg every six hours intravenously (2 g per day) or MEM 1 g every eight hours (3 g per day), were included in the study.

This study has shown that while acquisition costs of IC at a dose of 500 mg q6 h may be lower than for MEM 1 g q8 h, mean total costs per day were not significantly different between IC and MEM, indicating that medicine costs are only a small element of the overall costs of managing moderate to severe infections.

      "An important factor that will help in advancement of the pharmacy services in any country would be to understand the public needs, expectation and satisfaction. There are limited published studies conducted in Sultanate of Oman regarding the perception and satisfaction of public on the role and services provided by pharmacists. The present study was conducted to assess the perception and satisfaction of general public in Sultanate of Oman on the roles, and services received from the pharmacists. The survey was conducted among public in the Governorates of A'Dahera and Muscat in Oman during 2013. The questionnaire had items to assess two aspects: perception on the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and satisfaction on the services provided. The responses to the questions marked in a five point Likert scale were assessed using a scoring scheme. Accordingly, the median perception, and satisfaction score and median total score for the participants were estimated. The median scores of the participants were related with the demographics of the participants and frequency of visit to pharmacy. A total of 390 completed questionnaires were obtained. The median total score of the participants based on all the questions was 79 (Inter Quartile Range (IQR), 12) which represents a moderate score. The median perception and satisfaction scores were 44 (IQR 5) and 34 (IQR 7) which represent a good and moderate score, respectively. Perception of the participants differed based on employment status, frequency of visit to pharmacy and governorate represented by participants while satisfaction was influenced by educational qualification and frequency of visit to pharmacy. Public had a good perception regarding the roles of the pharmacists while they were only moderately satisfied with the services provided. Steps have to be taken to improve the services and relationship of pharmacists, and thereby improve the satisfaction of the customers. An extended study in a broader population involving more governorates will provide an enhanced representation regarding this important aspect. KFShj@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

      "The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of simultaneous factors that potentially keep patients far from achieving target INR range at discharge in hospitalized patients. Prospective cross-sectional observational study conducted at the Cardiology Department and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Assiut University Hospitals. One-hundred and twenty patients were enrolled in the study from July 2013 to January 2014. Outcome measures were discharge INRs, bleeding and thromboembolic episodes. Bivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression were conducted to determine independent risk factors that can keep patients outside target INR range. Patients who were newly initiated warfarin on hospital admission were given low initiation dose (2.8 mg +- 0.9). They were more likely to have INR values below 1.5 during hospital stay, 13 (27.7%) patients compared with 9 (12.3%) previously treated patients, respectively (p = .034). We found that the best predictors of achieving below target INR range relative to within target INR range were; shorter hospital stay periods (OR, 0.82 for every day increase [95% CI, 0.72-0.94]), being a male patient (OR, 2.86 [95% CI, 1.05-7.69]), concurrent infection (OR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.59]) and new initiation of warfarin therapy on hospital admission (OR, 3.73 [95% CI, 1.28-10.9]). Gender, new initiation of warfarin therapy on hospital admission, shorter hospital stay periods and concurrent infection can have a significant effect on discharge INRs. Initiation of warfarin without giving loading doses increases the risk of having INRs below 1.5 during hospital stay and increases the likelihood of a patient to be discharged with INR below target range. Following warfarin dosing nomograms and careful monitoring of the effect of various factors on warfarin response should be greatly considered. 10126622740\n",

Liqui-solid compact converts a liquid drug or drug solution into a free flowing powder with enhanced dissolution rate. In case of solid dispersion drug is molecularly dispersed in a hydrophilic polymer in solid state. In the present study, Liqui-solid and solid dispersion techniques were applied to enhance the dissolution of the Hydrochlorothiazide. Three formulations of Hydrochlorothiazide were prepared by liqui-solid technique using micro crystalline cellulose as carrier material and colloidal silicon dioxide as coating material. Water, poly ethylene glycol-400 and Tween-60 were used as solvent system. Solid dispersions of Hydrochlorothiazide were prepared by solvent fusion method using PEG-4000 as carrier polymer. Tablets were subjected to evaluation of various physical and chemical characteristics. Dissolution profiles of tablets prepared by the novel techniques were compared with marketed conventional tablets. Model independent techniques including similarity factor, dissimilarity factor and dissolution efficiency were applied for comparison of dissolution profiles. The results obtained indicated that liqui-solid compact formulations were more effective in enhancing the dissolution rate compared with solid dispersion technique. The liqui-solid compacts improved the dissolution rate up to 95% while the solid dispersion increased it to 88%. +86-15640991315\n",

Directly compressed tablets were formed based on experimental design. Face-centred central composite design was applied with two factors and 3 levels, where amount of sodium alginate (X 1) and L-HPC (X2 ) were the numerical factors. Applied types of L-HPCs and their 1:1 mixture were included in a categorical factor (X 3). Studied parameters were floating lag time, floating time, floating force, swelling behaviour of tablets and dissolution of paracetamol, which was used as a model active substance. Due to their physical character, L-HPCs had different water uptake and flowability. Lower flowability and lower water uptake was observed after 60 min at L-HPC 11 compared to L-HPC B1. Shorter floating times were detected at L-HPC 11 and L-HPC mixtures with 0.5% content of sodium alginate, whereas alginate was the only significant factor. Evaluating results of drug release and swelling studies on floating tablets revealed correlation, which can serve to help to understand the mechanism of action of L-HPCs in the field development of gastroretentive dosage forms.

Poor oral bioavailability and shorter half-life (3.5-5 h) remain a major clinical limitation of NFV leading to unpredictable drug bioavailability and frequent dosing. In this context, the objective of the present study was to formulate NFV loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), which can increase the solubility and oral bioavailability along with sustained release of the drug. NFV loaded PLGA-NPs were prepared by nanoprecipitation method using PLGA and Poloxomer 407. The prepared NPs were evaluated for particle size, zeta potential, morphology, drug content, entrapment efficiency (EE) and in vitro dissolution studies. Oral bioavailability studies were carried out in New Zealand rabbits by administering developed NFV PLGA-NPs and pure drug suspension. PLGA-NPs prepared by using 1:4 ratio of drug and PLGA, with a stirring rate of 1500 rpm for 4 h. The prepared NPs were in the size of 185 +- 0.83 nm with a zeta potential of 28.7 +- 0.09 mV. The developed NPs were found to be spherical with uniform size distribution. The drug content and EE of the optimized formulation were found to be 36 +- 0.19% and 72 +- 0.47% respectively. After oral administration of NFV PLGA-NPs, the relative bioavailability was enhanced about 4.94 fold compared to NFV suspension as a control. The results describe an effective strategy for oral delivery of NFV loaded PLGA NPs that helps in enhancing bioavailability and reduce the frequency of dosing. 1233473716\n",

During process optimization various parameters were studied such as: drug: polymer ratio, polymer ratio, concentration of emulsifier and stirring speed. Selected optimized formulations were studied for SEM, entrapment, floating behavior, drug release and kinetics. In-vivo floating ability (X-ray) study and in-vivo antidiabetic activity were performed on alloxan induced diabetic rats. Microspheres prepared with different viscosity grade HPMC were spherical shaped with smooth surface. Size of microspheres was in the range of 181.1-248 mm. Good entrapment and buoyancy were observed for 12 h. X-ray image showed that optimized formulation remained buoyant for more than 6 h. Optimized formulation treated group shows significant (p < 0.01) reduction in blood glucose level as compared to pure drug treated group.

Like any other analytical method some difficulties exist in employing mass spectrometry, mainly when it is used to test biological samples, such as to detect drug candidates in mammalian serum, which is rich in proteins, lipids and other contents that may interfere with the investigational drug. The complexity of the serum proteome presents challenges for efficient sample preparation and adequate sensitivity for mass spectrometry analysis of drugs. Enrichment procedures prior to the drug analysis are often needed and as a result, the study of serum or plasma components usually demands either methods of purification or depletion of one or more. Selection of the best combination of sample introduction method is a crucial determinant of the sensitivity and accuracy of mass spectrometry. The aim of this study was to determine the highest serum protein precipitation activity of five commonly used sample preparation methods and test their suitability for mass spectrometry. We spiked three small molecules into rabbit serum and applied different protein precipitation methods to determine their precipitation activity and applicability as a mass spectrometry introductory tool.

Influence of the molar ratio of SCA to the glucopyranose units (SCA/GU), reaction time, temperature and the amount of sodium hydroxide on the degree of substitution (DS) and the reaction efficiency (RE) was studied. An optimal concentration of 30% of NaOH, for a reaction time of 1 h at 50 degC and molar ratio (SCA/GU) equal to 1.0, yielded an optimal DS of 0.55 and a RE of 55%. SEM micrographs revealed that the carboxymethylation assigned the structural arrangement of CMPGS and caused the granular disintegration. Wide angle diffraction X-ray (XRD) showed that the crystallinity of starch was obviously varied after carboxymethylation. New bands in FTIR spectra at 1417 and 1603 cm(-1) indicated the presence of carboxymethyl groups. The solubility and viscosity of CMPGS increased with an increase in the degree of modification. In order to investigate the influence of DS on physical and drug release properties, CMPGS obtained with DS in the range of 0.12-0.55 was evaluated as tablet excipient for sustained drug release. Dissolution tests performed in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), with Ibuprofen as drug model (25% loading) showed that CMPGS seems suitable to be used as sustained release excipient since the drug release was driven over a period up to 8 h. The in vitro release kinetics studies revealed that all formulations fit well with Korsmeyer-Peppas model and the mechanism of drug release is non-Fickian diffusion. IA2rwYZ4@163.com\n",

      "The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is one of the three places on Earth that registered the most intense warming in the last 50 years, almost five times the global mean. This warming has strongly affected the cryosphere, causing the largest ice-shelf collapses ever observed and the retreat of 87% of glaciers. Ecosystem responses, although increasingly predicted, have been mainly reported for pelagic systems. However, and despite most Antarctic species being benthic, responses in the Antarctic benthos have been detected in only a few species, and major effects at assemblage level are unknown. This is probably due to the scarcity of baselines against which to assess change. We performed repeat surveys of coastal benthos in 1994, 1998, and 2010, analyzing community structure and environmental variables at King George Island, Antarctica. We report a marked shift in an Antarctic benthic community that can be linked to ongoing climate change. However, rather than temperature as the primary factor, we highlight the resulting increased sediment runoff, triggered by glacier retreat, as the potential causal factor. The sudden shift from a \"\"filter feeders-ascidian domination\"\" to a \"\"mixed assemblage\"\" suggests that thresholds (for example, of tolerable sedimentation) and alternative equilibrium states, depending on the reversibility of the changes, could be possible traits of this ecosystem. Sedimentation processes will be increasing under the current scenario of glacier retreat, and attention needs to be paid to its effects along the AP. 11479084000\n",

Unfortunately, the power density of the MFCs at present is significantly lower than the theoretical value because of technical limitations including low bacteria loading capacity and difficult electron transfer between the bacteria and the electrode. We reported a three-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogel (GA) decorated with platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) as an efficient freestanding anode for MFCs. The 3D GA/Pt-based anode has a continuous 3D macroporous structure that is favorable for microorganism immobilization and efficient electrolyte transport. Moreover, GA scaffold is homogenously decorated with Pt NPs to further enhance extracellular charge transfer between the bacteria and the anode. The MFCs constructed with 3D GA/Pt-based anode generate a remarkable maximum power density of 1460 mW/m(2), 5.3 times higher than that based on carbon cloth (273 mW/m(2)). It deserves to be stressed that 1460 mW/m(2) obtained from the GA/Pt anode shows the superior performance among all the reported MFCs inoculated with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Moreover, as a demonstration of the real application, the MFC equipped with the freestanding GA/Pt anode has been successfully applied in driving timer for the first time, which opens the avenue toward the real application of the MFCs. 1438346028\n",

Trade networks of commodities are susceptible to cascades of supply shocks that increase systemic trade risks and pose a threat to geopolitical stability. We show that supply risk, scarcity, and price volatility of nonfuel mineral resources are intricately connected with the structure of the worldwide trade networks spanned by these resources. At the global level, we demonstrate that the scarcity of a resource is closely related to the susceptibility of the trade network with respect to cascading shocks. At the regional level, we find that, to some extent, region-specific price volatility and supply risk can be understood by centrality measures that capture systemic trade risk. The resources associated with the highest systemic trade risk indicators are often those that are produced as by-products of major metals.

BAF complexes contain an ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate)-driven remodeling enzyme (either BRG1 or BRM) and multiple protein interaction domains including bromodomains, an evolutionary conserved acetyl lysine-dependent protein interaction motif that recruits transcriptional regulators to acetylated chromatin. We report a potent and cell active protein interaction inhibitor, PFI-3, that selectively binds to essential BAF bromodomains. The high specificity of PFI-3 was achieved on the basis of a novel binding mode of a salicylic acid head group that led to the replacement of water molecules typically maintained in other bromodomain inhibitor complexes. We show that exposure of embryonic stem cells to PFI-3 led to deprivation of stemness and deregulated lineage specification. Furthermore, differentiation of trophoblast stem cells in the presence of PFI-3 was markedly enhanced. The data present a key function of BAF bromodomains in stem cell maintenance and differentiation, introducing a novel versatile chemical probe for studies on acetylation-dependent cellular processes controlled by BAF remodeling complexes. 1090474490\n",

A fundamental question that is relevant to both basic research and application is whether ferroelectric (FE) polarization can be associated with skyrmions' magnetic texture and whether these objects can be manipulated by electric fields. We study the interplay between magnetism and electric polarization in the lacunar spinel GaV4S8, which undergoes a structural transition associated with orbital ordering at 44 K and reveals a complex magnetic phase diagram below 13 K, including ferromagnetic, cycloidal, and Neel-type skyrmion lattice (SkL) phases. We found that the orbitally ordered phase of GaV4S8 is FE with a sizable polarization of ~1 mC/cm(2). Moreover, we observed spin-driven excess polarizations in all magnetic phases; hence, GaV4S8 hosts three different multiferroic phases with coexisting polar and magnetic order. These include the SkL phase, where we predict a strong spatial modulation of FE polarization close to the skyrmion cores. By taking into account the crystal symmetry and spin patterns of the magnetically ordered phases, we identify exchange striction as the main microscopic mechanism behind the spin-driven FE polarization in each multiferroic phase. Because GaV4S8 is unique among known SkL host materials owing to its polar crystal structure and the observed strong magnetoelectric effect, this study is an important step toward the nondissipative electric field control of skyrmions. ra0ruG2S@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

Moreover, we find that the surface states show an unexpectedly rich structure, including both topological Fermi arcs and several topologically trivial closed contours in the vicinity of the Weyl points, which provides a promising platform to study the interplay between topological and trivial surface states on a Weyl semimetal's surface. We directly demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence and establish the topologically nontrivial nature of the Weyl semimetal state in TaP, by resolving the net number of chiral edge modes on a closed path that encloses the Weyl node. This also provides, for the first time, an experimentally practical approach to demonstrating a bulk Weyl fermion from a surface state dispersion measured in photoemission. 1389206408\n",

Perturbations in the anatomical connectivity of neocortical circuits resulting in their functional defects have been hypothesized to contribute to the underlying etiology of these disorders. We tested this idea by probing alterations in the functional and structural connectivity of both local and long-ranging neocortical circuits in the Fmr1 (-/y) mouse model of FXS. To achieve this, we combined in vivo ultrahigh-field diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and viral tracing approaches in adult mice. Our results show an anatomical hyperconnectivity phenotype for the primary visual cortex (V1), but a disproportional low connectivity of V1 with other neocortical regions. These structural data are supported by defects in the structural integrity of the subcortical white matter in the anterior and posterior forebrain. These anatomical alterations might contribute to the observed functional decoupling across neocortical regions. We therefore identify FXS as a \"\"connectopathy,\"\" providing a translational model for understanding sensory processing defects and functional decoupling of neocortical areas in FXS and ASD.

A depositional age of 2495 +- 14 million years and an initial (187)Os/(188)Os of 0.34 +- 0.19 were obtained for rhenium- and molybdenum-rich black shales. The initial (187)Os/(188)Os is higher than the mantle/extraterrestrial value of 0.11, pointing to mild environmental oxygenation and oxidative mobilization of rhenium, molybdenum, and radiogenic osmium from the upper continental crust and to contemporaneous transport of these metals to seawater. By contrast, stratigraphically overlying black shales are rhenium- and molybdenum-poor and have a mantle-like initial (187)Os/(188)Os of 0.06 +- 0.09, indicating a reduced continental flux of rhenium, molybdenum, and osmium to seawater because of a drop in environmental O2 levels.

      "Even though polycrystalline graphene has shown a surprisingly high tensile strength, the influence of inherent grain boundaries on such property remains unclear. We study the fracture properties of a series of polycrystalline graphene models of increasing thermodynamic stability, as obtained from a long molecular dynamics simulation at an elevated temperature. All of the models show the typical and well-documented brittle fracture behavior of polycrystalline graphene; however, a clear decrease in all fracture properties is observed with increasing annealing time. The remarkably high fracture properties obtained for the most disordered (less annealed) structures arise from the formation of many nonpropagating prefracture cracks, significantly retarding failure. The stability of these reversible cracks is due to the nonlocal character of load transfer after a bond rupture in very disordered systems. It results in an insufficient strain level on neighboring bonds to promote fracture propagation. Although polycrystallinity seems to be an unavoidable feature of chemically synthesized graphenes, these results suggest that targeting highly disordered states might be a convenient way to obtain improved mechanical properties. thTRT65@qq.com\n",

Macroscopic spin ensembles have been historically important in the development of quantum algorithms for these prospective technologies and remain strong candidates for implementing them today. This strength derives from their long-lived quantum coherence, strong signal, and ability to couple collectively to external degrees of freedom. Nonetheless, preparing ensembles of genuinely entangled spin states has required high magnetic fields and cryogenic temperatures or photochemical reactions. We demonstrate that entanglement can be realized in solid-state spin ensembles at ambient conditions. We use hybrid registers comprising of electron-nuclear spin pairs that are localized at color-center defects in a commercial SiC wafer. We optically initialize 10(3) identical registers in a 40-mm(3) volume (with [Formula: see text] fidelity) and deterministically prepare them into the maximally entangled Bell states (with 0.88 +- 0.07 fidelity). To verify entanglement, we develop a register-specific quantum-state tomography protocol.

In contrast, there is little evidence to date that whole genome duplication (WGD) has played a significant role in the evolution of their putative extant sister lineage, the gymnosperms. Recent analyses of the spruce genome, the first published conifer genome, failed to detect evidence of WGDs in gene age distributions and attributed many aspects of conifer biology to a lack of WGDs. We present evidence for three ancient genome duplications during the evolution of gymnosperms, based on phylogenomic analyses of transcriptomes from 24 gymnosperms and 3 outgroups. We use a new algorithm to place these WGD events in phylogenetic context: two in the ancestry of major conifer clades (Pinaceae and cupressophyte conifers) and one in Welwitschia (Gnetales). We also confirm that a WGD hypothesized to be restricted to seed plants is indeed not shared with ferns and relatives (monilophytes), a result that was unclear in earlier studies. Contrary to previous genomic research that reported an absence of polyploidy in the ancestry of contemporary gymnosperms, our analyses indicate that polyploidy has contributed to the evolution of conifers and other gymnosperms. As in the flowering plants, the evolution of the large genome sizes of gymnosperms involved both polyploidy and repetitive element activity. Xizo@126.com\n",

      "The roots, stems, leaves, and vascular circuitry of higher plants are responsible for conveying the chemical signals that regulate growth and functions. From a certain perspective, these features are analogous to the contacts, interconnections, devices, and wires of discrete and integrated electronic circuits. Although many attempts have been made to augment plant function with electroactive materials, plants' \"\"circuitry\"\" has never been directly merged with electronics. We report analog and digital organic electronic circuits and devices manufactured in living plants. The four key components of a circuit have been achieved using the xylem, leaves, veins, and signals of the plant as the template and integral part of the circuit elements and functions. With integrated and distributed electronics in plants, one can envisage a range of applications including precision recording and regulation of physiology, energy harvesting from photosynthesis, and alternatives to genetic modification for plant optimization.

      "Slight shifts in arrangement within biological photonic nanostructures can produce large color differences, and sexual selection often leads to high color diversity in clades with structural colors. We use phylogenetic reconstruction, electron microscopy, spectrophotometry, and optical modeling to show an opposing pattern of nanostructural diversification accompanied by unusual conservation of blue color in tarantulas (Araneae: Theraphosidae). In contrast to other clades, blue coloration in phylogenetically distant tarantulas peaks within a narrow 20-nm region around 450 nm. Both quasi-ordered and multilayer nanostructures found in different tarantulas produce this blue color. Thus, even within monophyletic lineages, tarantulas have evolved strikingly similar blue coloration through divergent mechanisms. The poor color perception and lack of conspicuous display during courtship of tarantulas argue that these colors are not sexually selected. Therefore, our data contrast with sexual selection that typically produces a diverse array of colors with a single structural mechanism by showing that natural selection on structural color in tarantulas resulted in convergence on similar color through diverse structural mechanisms. ayal@163.com\n",

      "Understanding climatic influences on the rates and mechanisms of landscape erosion is an unresolved problem in Earth science that is important for quantifying soil formation rates, sediment and solute fluxes to oceans, and atmospheric CO2 regulation by silicate weathering. Glaciated landscapes record the erosional legacy of glacial intervals through moraine deposits and U-shaped valleys, whereas more widespread unglaciated hillslopes and rivers lack obvious climate signatures, hampering mechanistic theory for how climate sets fluxes and form. Today, periglacial processes in high-elevation settings promote vigorous bedrock-to-regolith conversion and regolith transport, but the extent to which frost processes shaped vast swaths of low- to moderate-elevation terrain during past climate regimes is not well established. By combining a mechanistic frost weathering model with a regional Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate reconstruction derived from a paleo-Earth System Model, paleovegetation data, and a paleoerosion archive, we propose that frost-driven sediment production was pervasive during the LGM in our unglaciated Pacific Northwest study site, coincident with a 2.5 times increase in erosion relative to modern rates. Our findings provide a novel framework to quantify how climate modulates sediment production over glacial-interglacial cycles in mid-latitude unglaciated terrain. TMozo@qq.com\n",

We used x-ray virtual models of the inner ear to predict the habit of Dinilysia patagonica, a stem snake closely related to the origin of modern snakes. Previous work has shown that modern snakes perceive substrate vibrations via their inner ear. Our data show that D. patagonica and modern burrowing squamates share a unique spherical vestibule in the inner ear, as compared with swimmers and habitat generalists. We built predictive models for snake habit based on their vestibular shape, which estimated D. patagonica and the hypothetical ancestor of crown snakes as burrowers with high probabilities. This study provides an extensive comparative data set to test fossoriality quantitatively in stem snakes, and it shows that burrowing was predominant in the lineages leading to modern crown snakes. +86-84565029590\n",

      "The first diverse and morphologically complex macroscopic communities appear in the late Ediacaran period, 575 to 541 million years ago (Ma). The enigmatic organisms that make up these communities are thought to have formed simple ecosystems characterized by a narrow range of feeding modes, with most restricted to the passive absorption of organic particles (osmotrophy). We test between competing feeding models for the iconic Ediacaran organism Tribrachidium heraldicum using computational fluid dynamics. We show that the external morphology of Tribrachidium passively directs water flow toward the apex of the organism and generates low-velocity eddies above apical \"\"pits.\"\" These patterns of fluid flow are inconsistent with osmotrophy and instead support the interpretation of Tribrachidium as a passive suspension feeder. This finding provides the oldest empirical evidence for suspension feeding at 555 to 550 Ma, ~10 million years before the Cambrian explosion, and demonstrates that Ediacaran organisms formed more complex ecosystems in the latest Precambrian, involving a larger number of ecological guilds, than currently appreciated. +86-1317135719\n",

Despite the technological relevance of the energy-level alignment at organic heterointerfaces, and despite continued scientific interest, a reliable model that can quantitatively predict the full range of phenomena observed at such interfaces is notably absent. We identify the limitations of previous attempts to formulate such a model and highlight inconsistencies in the interpretation of the experimental data they were based on. We then develop a theoretical framework, which we demonstrate to accurately reproduce experiment.

Nudivirus hijacking was also at the origin of protective particles from braconid wasps. However, we show here that the viral genes produce \"\"liposomes\"\" that wrap and deliver V. canescens virulence proteins, whereas the particles are used as gene transfer agents in braconid wasps.

      "Intrinsic immune defenses mediated by restriction factors inhibit productive viral infections. Select viruses rapidly establish latent infections and, with gene expression profiles that imply cell-autonomous intrinsic defenses, may be the most effective immune control measure against latent reservoirs. We illustrate that lysine-specific demethylases (KDMs) are restriction factors that prevent human cytomegalovirus from establishing latency by removing repressive epigenetic modifications from histones associated with the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP), stimulating the expression of a viral lytic phase target of cell-mediated adaptive immunity. The viral UL138 protein negates this defense by preventing KDM association with the MIEP. The presence of an intrinsic defense against latency and the emergence of a cognate neutralizing viral factor indicate that \"\"arms races\"\" between hosts and viruses over lifelong colonization exist at the cellular level. 1563913119\n",

      "Kisspeptins are a group of peptide fragments encoded by the KISS1 gene in humans. They bind to kisspeptin receptors with equal efficacy. Kisspeptins and their receptors are expressed by neurons in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Oestrogen mediates negative feedback of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion via the arcuate nucleus. Conversely, it exerts positive feedback via the anteroventral periventricular nucleus. The sexual dimorphism of these nuclei accounts for the differential behaviour of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis between genders. Kisspeptins are essential for reproductive function. Puberty is regulated by the maturation of kisspeptin neurons and by interactions between kisspeptins and leptin. Hence, kisspeptins have potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Kisspeptin agonists may be used to localise lesions in cases of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction and evaluate the gonadotrophic potential of subfertile individuals. Kisspeptin antagonists may be useful as contraceptives in women, through the prevention of premature luteinisation during in vitro fertilisation, and in the treatment of sex steroid-dependent diseases and metastatic cancers. u8Cu2VER@qq.com\n",

NOAC have fewer food and drug interactions compared to warfarin; hence, the patient will require fewer clinic visits. However, the short half-life of NOAC means that twice-a-day dosing is needed and there is higher risk of a prothrombotic state when doses are missed.

This randomised controlled trial recruited 76 patients at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital who were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II, aged 21 to 65 and scheduled to undergo elective extraction of all four wisdom teeth under general anaesthesia. Patients with a history of long-term use or allergy to melatonin were excluded. The patients received either 6 mg melatonin or a placebo 90 minutes before surgery. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at multiple time intervals for postoperative pain and preoperative anxiety, patient satisfaction and first-night sleep quality scores were obtained. Mixed-effects regression models were used for longitudinal analysis of VAS pain, anxiety and satisfaction scores. Maximum VAS scores for pain and anxiety were 18.6 +- 19.1 mm at 60 minutes postoperatively and 26.2 +- 23.4 mm at 90 minutes preoperatively, respectively. After adjusting for gender, female patients who received melatonin had a faster rate of reduction of VAS pain (p = 0.020) and anxiety scores (p = 0.003) over time compared to the placebo group. No such effect was demonstrated in male patients. There was no significant difference in sleep quality or satisfaction scores.

Although LV dimensions, mass and ejection fraction remained unchanged, LV diastolic and systolic functions improved (as observed on TDI). Early diastolic (E'), late diastolic (A') and systolic (S') mitral annular velocities increased significantly (p < 0.05). There was significant improvement in TDI-derived parameters among the patients who had isolated AVR, while among the patients who had concomitant AVR with CABG, only S' had significant improvement (p = 0.028). TDI was able to detect improvements in LV systolic and diastolic function after AVR for severe AS.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of micro- and macroalbuminuria using a more stringent criterion of two positive quantitative urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) tests. We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were followed up at a primary care clinic in Singapore.

The FFQ, consisting of 94 food items from 12 food groups, was compared with a three-day dietary record (3DR) as the reference method. The reproducibility of the FFQ was assessed through repeat administration (FFQ2), seven days after the first administration (FFQ1). The results of the validation study demonstrated good acceptance of the FFQ. Mean intake of macronutrients in FFQ1 and 3DR correlated well, although the FFQ intake data tended to be higher. Cross-classification of nutrient intake between the two methods showed that < 7% of subjects were grossly misclassified. Moderate correlations noted between the two methods ranged from r = 0.310 (p < 0.001) for fat to r = 0.497 (p < 0.001) for energy. The reproducibility of the FFQ, as assessed by Cronbach's alpha, ranged from 0.61 (protein) to 0.70 (energy, carbohydrates and fat). Spearman's correlations between FFQ1 and FFQ2 ranged from rho = 0.333 (p = 0.072) for protein to rho = 0.479 (p < 0.01) for fat. These findings indicate that the FFQ is valid and reliable for measuring the average intake of energy and macronutrients in a population of multi-ethnic children aged 7-12 years in Malaysia. 1yuGA@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

We here report an effective method to recover pure tumor cells from malignant ascites. We used lavage fluid from 13 patients with malignant ascites who were treated with modified cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (KM-CART). Cellular components were separated from the lavage fluid by centrifugation, enzymatic digestion and hemolysis. Tumor cells were purified by depleting CD45(+) leukocytes with antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. The tumor cell lysate was extracted by freeze-and-thaw cycles. The mean obtained total cell number was 7.50 x 10(7) cells (range 4.40 x 10(6)-2.48 x 10(8) cells).

In the present study, we examined the ionomic responses to nutrient deficiency in maize grown in the field in long-term fertilizer trials. Furthermore, the available elements in the field soils were analyzed to investigate their changes under long-term fertilizer treatment and the ionomic relationships between plant and soil. Maize was cultivated in a field with the following five long-term fertilizer treatments: complete fertilization, fertilization without nitrogen, without phosphorus, without potassium, and no fertilization. Concentrations of 22 elements in leaves at an early flowering stage and in soils after harvest were determined. The fertilizer treatments changed the availabilities of many elements in soils. For example, available cesium was decreased by 39 % and increased by 126 % by fertilizations without nitrogen and potassium, respectively. Effects of treatments on the ionome in leaves were evaluated using the translocation ratio (the concentration in leaves relative to the available concentration in soils) for each element. Nitrogen deficiency specifically increased the uptake ability of molybdenum, which might induce the enhancement of nitrogen assimilation and/or endophytic nitrogen fixation in plant. Potassium deficiency drastically enhanced the uptake ability of various cationic elements. These elements might act as alternatives to K in osmoregulation and counterion of organic/inorganic anions. Two major groups of elements were detected by multivariate analyses of plant ionome. Elements in the same group may be linked more or less in uptake and/or translocation systems. No significant correlation between plant and soil was found in concentrations of many elements, even though various soil extraction methods were applied, implying that the interactions between the target and other elements in soil must be considered when analyzing mineral dynamics between plant and soil. y3GK@fudan.edu.cn\n",

Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, three meta-heuristic algorithms, namely ant colony system, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing are designed and implemented, respectively. We also propose a novel algorithm named LDF (largest density first) which is improved from LPT (longest processing time first). The computational experiments compared these meta-heuristic algorithms with LDF, LPT and LS (list scheduling), and the experimental results show that SA performs the best in most cases. However, LDF is better than SA in some conditions, moreover, the running time of LDF is much shorter than SA. 12520502298\n",

      "The determination of the alcoholic strength in spirits and liqueurs is required to control the labelling of alcoholic beverages. The reference methodology prescribes a distillation step followed by densimetric measurement. The classic distillation using a Vigreux rectifying column and a West condenser is time consuming and error-prone, especially for liqueurs that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For this reason, this methodology suggests the use of an automated steam distillation device as alternative. The novel instrument comprises an increased steam power, a redesigned geometry of the condenser and a larger cooling coil with controllable flow, compared to previously available devices. Method optimization applying D-optimal and central composite designs showed significant influence of sample volume, distillation time and coolant flow, while other investigated parameters such as steam power, receiver volume, or the use of pipettes or flasks for sample measurement did not significantly influence the results. The method validation was conducted using the following settings: steam power 70 %, sample volume 25 mL transferred using pipettes, receiver volume 50 mL, coolant flow 7 L/min, and distillation time as long as possible just below the calibration mark. For four different liqueurs covering the typical range of these products between 15 and 35 % vol, the method showed an adequate precision, with relative standard deviations below 0.4 % (intraday) and below 0.6 % (interday). The absolute standard deviations were between 0.06 % vol and 0.08 % vol (intraday) and between 0.07 % vol and 0.10 % vol (interday). The improved automatic steam distillation devices offer an excellent alternative for sample cleanup of volatiles from complex matrices. A major advantage are the low costs for consumables per analysis (only distilled water is needed). For alcoholic strength determination, the method has become more rugged than before, and there are only few influences that would lead to incomplete distillation. Our validation parameters have shown that the performance of the method corresponds to the data presented for the reference method and we believe that automated steam distillation, can be used for the purpose of labelling control of alcoholic beverages. 4PYB@126.com\n",

Since the implementation of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption in 2008, Guatemala's central authority for adoption has prioritized domestic placements for children over intercountry adoption. A possible attitudinal barrier to domestic adoption in Guatemala-negative attitudes and prejudice against Indigenous people-was investigated through questionnaires measuring attitudes toward adoption and attitudes toward and social distance from the two major ethnic groups (Ladino and Indigenous). Guatemalan university students (N = 177, 61 % men) were recruited from basic required courses at a private university. Results showed that attitudes toward adoption in general were more favorable than toward interethnic adoption, with the most negative attitudes toward adoption of Ladino children by Indigenous parents. Multiple regression and analysis of covariance models revealed that female gender, experience with adoption and more positive attitudes about Indigenous persons were associated with more positive attitudes toward adoption. The findings imply that negative attitudes toward Indigenous persons are associated with negative attitudes toward adoption, and serve as barriers to promoting domestic adoption in Guatemala. bmiDDd6@fudan.edu.cn\n",

Postoperative circulating IGF-1 level, ratio of IGF-1/IGFBP3 and MMSE score significantly decreased, whereas IGFBP3 level significantly increased compared with preoperative values in total patients. The change trends of circulating IGF-1 level and MMSE score were similar. Preoperative circulating IGF-1 level, ratio and MMSE score were significantly lower in POCD group compared to non-POCD group.

The mean CT number and the kurtosis and skewness from the automated extraction were 35.0 Hounsfield units, 0.63, and 0.51, respectively, and were equivalent to those from the manual extraction (35.4 Hounsfield units, 0.59, and 0.46, respectively). The automated extraction of the brain-tissue region from whole-brain CT images was useful for histogram analysis of the brain-tissue region. d5lYgvP@qq.com\n",

In addition, to identify the clinical factors associated to the technique reliability. mpMRI was performed in 274 prostate cancer patients in order to refine the treatment decisions according to PSA, Gleason Score (GS) and cT-category. Comparisons between the cT and mT-category were performed, as well as the impact on the RT treatment [target volume, doses and hormonal therapy (HT)] independently if it was finally performed. Changes in HT indication for intermediate risk were also analyzed. mpMRI validation was performed with pathological staging (n = 90 patients finally decided to join surgery). The mpMRI upstaging range was 86-94 % for any PSA value or GS. Following mpMRI, 32.8 % of the patients (90/274) were assigned to a different risk group. Compared to cT-category, mpMRI identified more intermediate-risk (46.4 vs. 59.5 %) and high-risk (19.0 vs. 28.8 %) prostate cancer patients. This resulted in a higher indication (p < 0.05) of seminal vesicle irradiation (63.5 vs. 70.0 %), inclusion of any extracapsular disease (T3-T4) within the target volume (1.8 vs. 18.2 %), higher doses (65.3 vs. 88.3 %) and HT associated to RT (45.6 vs. 62.4 %). Global accuracy for mpMRI was higher compared to DRE/TRUS (8.9 vs. 71.1 %, p < 0.05). mpMRI reliability was independent of PSA or GS. mpMRI tumor staging significantly modified the RT treatment decisions in all prostate cancer risk groups. weqzSvj@tsinghua.edu.cn\n",

      "Japan has four seasons and many chances of low atmospheric pressure or approaches of typhoon, therefore it has been empirically known that the fluctuation of weather induces migraine in people. Generally, its mechanism has been interpreted as follows: physical loading, attributed by atmospheric pressure to human bodies, compresses or dilates human blood vessels, which leads to abnormality in blood flow and induces migraine. We report our examination of the stage in which migraine tends to be induced focusing on the variation of atmospheric pressure. Subjects were 34 patients with migraine, who were treated in our hospital. The patients included 31 females and three males, whose mean age was 32 +- 6.7. 22 patients had migraine with aura and 12 patients had migraine without aura. All of patients with migraine maintained a headache diary to record atmospheric pressures when they developed a migraine. The standard atmospheric pressure was defined as 1013 hPa, and with this value as the criterion, we investigated slight fluctuations in the atmospheric pressure when they developed a migraine. It was found that the atmospheric pressure when the patients developed a migraine was within 1003-1007 hPa in the approach of low atmospheric pressure and that the patients developed a migraine when the atmospheric pressure decreased by 6-10 hPa, slightly less than the standard atmospheric pressure. Small decreases of 6-10 hPa relative to the standard atmospheric pressure of 1013 hPa induced migraine attacks most frequently in patients with migraine. 2JbG@qq.com\n",

      "Proteins from the plant chromoplast are essential for many physiological processes such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Different protein extraction methods were tested to find the most robust method to obtain oil palm chromoplast proteins for mass spectrometry analysis. Initially, two different solvents were employed to reduce the fruit lipids. Then, two plant cell wall digestive enzymes were used to acquire the protoplasts to increase the protein extraction effectiveness. A two-stage centrifugation-based fractionation approach enhanced the number of identified proteins, particularly the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes. The effectiveness of each extraction method was assessed using protein yields and 2DE gel profiles. The ideal method was successfully used to establish the 2DE chromoplast proteome maps of low and high oleic acid mesocarps of oil palm. Further nanoLC-MS/MS analysis of the extracted chromoplast proteins led to the identification of 162 proteins, including some of the main enzymes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis. The established procedures would provide a solid foundation for further functional studies, including fatty acid biosynthetic expression profiling and evaluation of regulatory function. +86-6020819327\n",

      "Limb-salvage for primary malignant bone tumors in pediatric patients presents a unique challenge when resection includes an active physis. Early expandable prostheses required open surgical procedures to achieve lengthening. Newer prostheses are capable of achieving expansion without open procedures through the use of an electromagnetic field. This study reports our results with 90 consecutive expansion procedures using the Repiphysis((r)) prosthesis. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 20 patients (22 limbs) who underwent limb-salvage using the Repiphysis((r)) prosthesis from 2003 to 2015. There were 9 males and 11 females with a mean age of 9 years and 9 months (6-16 years). Reconstruction included the distal femur in 11 cases, total femur in four, proximal tibia in three, proximal humerus in three, and total humerus in one. Complications were reviewed and functional scores were recorded using the MSTS/ISOLS system. Five patients had a second prosthesis implanted during the course of the study for a total of 27 prostheses. The mean follow-up was 57 (6-148) months. Four patients have not been expanded: three due to death prior to lengthening, and one patient who has not yet developed a leg length discrepancy. Ninety consecutive expansion procedures were performed in 18 limbs in 16 patients. A mean of 9 (5-20) mm was gained per expansion and 4.8 cm per patient who has undergone expansion to date. Seven patients have reached skeletal maturity and have been converted to an adult endoprosthesis. These patients averaged 8 expansions per patient and a mean of 7.4 (1.8-12.9) cm in length gained. There were 15 complications in 11 patients including one dislocation, one contracture, four cases of aseptic loosening, five structural failures (three expansion mechanism failures and two tibial fractures), three deep infections, and one case of local recurrence. The mean MSTS score was 80 % (37-97 %) and the limb retention rate was 95 %. The results of this study are comparable to previous studies involving non-invasive prostheses. This study hopefully provides additional data for clinicians to consider when faced with limb threatening sarcomas in the immature skeleton. 1216388401\n",

      "Stochastic dynamics involved in ecological count data require distribution fitting procedures to model and make informed judgments. The study provides empirical research, focused on the provision of an early warning system and a spatial graph that can detect societal fire risks. It offers an opportunity for communities, organizations, risk managers, actuaries and governments to be aware of, and understand fire risks, so that they will increase the direct tackling of the threats posed by fire. Statistical distribution fitting method that best helps identify the stochastic dynamics of fire count data is used. The aim is to provide a fire-prediction model and fire spatial graph for observed fire count data. An empirical probability distribution model is fitted to the fire count data and compared to the theoretical probability distribution of the stochastic process of fire count data. The distribution fitted to the fire frequency count data helps identify the class of models that are exhibited by the fire and provides time leading decisions. The research suggests that fire frequency and loss (fire fatalities) count data in Ghana are best modelled with a Negative Binomial Distribution. The spatial map of observed fire frequency and fatality measured over 5 years (2007-2011) offers in this study a first regional assessment of fire frequency and fire fatality in Ghana. 12259181463\n",

However, performance of STOP-BANG as a screening tool for diagnosis of OSA in patients undergoing portable monitoring (PM) sleep study has not been well validated. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients older than 18 years who had unattended portable monitoring sleep study done at a VA medical center between June 2012 and October 2014. STOP-BANG questionnaire and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) were routinely done prior to study. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) various STOP-BANG score thresholds were calculated for diagnosis of OSA defined by Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) >=5. Out of 502 unattended portable monitoring sleep studies, there were 465 males and 37 females. STOP-BANG thresholds of >=2 and 3 have high sensitivity of 99.8 and 98.9 %, respectively, but very low specificity. Higher score thresholds of >=7 and 8 have high specificity of 95 and 98.3 %, and PPV of 98.1 and 98.5 %, respectively, but very low sensitivity. A threshold of >=7 in patients with BMI >=30 was 100 % specific. The false negative rate for unattended portable monitoring sleep study compared to in-lab study was 80 %. STOP-BANG score thresholds of >=7 and 8 are highly specific and have high PPV and therefore can potentially reduce need of diagnostic sleep studies in selected patients. Score thresholds of <=2 or 3 are highly sensitive for AHI >=5 by unattended portable monitoring sleep study but have high false negative rates. Therefore, in-lab sleep study should be performed to rule out OSA. 11597865695\n",

In children and adolescents with a physical disability or chronic disease participation in both recreational and competitive sports is often reduced, while for this population an active lifestyle may be even more important in reaching optimal levels of physical and psychosocial health. Therefore, the aim of the Health in Adapted Youth Sports (HAYS) Study is to determine both negative and positive effects of sports on children and adolescents with a chronic disease or physical disability. In this cross-sectional study differences will be compared in regards to physical and psychosocial health, cognitive functioning, school performance, daily physical activity and injuries between children and adolescents with a chronic disease or physical disability who participate in sports and those who do not. Children and adolescents, both ambulatory and wheelchair dependent, in the age of 10-19 years with a physical disability or chronic disease will be included. \"\"Sports\"\" is defined as participation in an organized sport at least two times a week for a duration of 3 months or more prior to the assessment. Parametric and non-parametric statistics will be used to determine the differences between the two groups. This study provides insight in the effects of sports participation in relation to health, psychosocial functioning, physical activity and school performance in children and adolescents (10-19 years) with a chronic disease or physical disability.

The present study examined the prospective association of aerobic and resistance exercise with total daily energy expenditure and PA in previously sedentary, young men. Nine men (27.0 +- 3.3 years) completed two 16-week exercise programs (3 exercise sessions per week) of aerobic and resistance exercise separated by a minimum of 6 weeks in random order. Energy expenditure and PA were measured with the SenseWear Mini Armband prior to each intervention as well as during week 1, week 8 and week 16 of the aerobic and resistance exercise program. Body composition was measured via dual x-ray absorptiometry. Body composition did not change in response to either exercise intervention. Total daily energy expenditure on exercise days increased by 443 +- 126 kcal/d and 239 +- 152 kcal/d for aerobic and resistance exercise, respectively (p < 0.01). Non-exercise moderate-to-vigorous PA, however, decreased on aerobic exercise days (-148 +- 161 kcal/d; p = 0.03). There was no change in total daily energy expenditure and PA on non-exercise days with aerobic exercise while resistance exercise was associated with an increase in moderate-to-vigorous PA during non-exercise days (216 +- 178 kcal/d, p = 0.01). Results of the present study suggest a compensatory reduction in PA in response to aerobic exercise. Resistance exercise, on the other hand, appears to facilitate non-exercise PA, particularly on non-exercise days, which may lead to more sustainable adaptations in response to an exercise program.

The main transmission vector is the consumption or handling of contaminated chicken meat, since chicken can be colonized asymptomatically by C. jejuni. However, water has been implicated as the transmission vector in a few outbreaks. One possibility is the contamination of water effluent by C. jejuni originating from chicken farm. The ability of C. jejuni to be transmitted by water would be closely associated to its ability to survive in water. Therefore, in this study, we have evaluated the ability of reference strains and chicken-isolated strains to survive in water. Defined water media were used, since the composition of tap water is variable. We showed that some isolates survive better than others in defined freshwater (Fraquil) and that the survival was affected by temperature and the concentration of NaCl. By comparing the ability of C. jejuni to survive in water with other phenotypic properties previously tested, we showed that the ability to survive in water was negatively correlated with autoagglutination. Our data showed that not all chicken isolates have the same ability to survive in water, which is probably due to difference in genetic content. +86-9368042226\n",

      "Dexmedetomidine (Dex), a highly selective a2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been shown to attenuate systemic inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The protective effects of Dex may reportedly be due to the activation of the a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAChR)-dependent cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Spleen has been shown to play a pivotal role in the neural cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. However, little is known about the specific function of spleen in the protective effects of Dex against sepsis. To investigate the role of spleen in the treatment of Dex against sepsis, we studied the effects of preemptive administration of Dex to septic mice on the NF-kB p65 activation and downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the spleen. Our results provided evidence that Dex treatment attenuated LPS-activated NF-kB p65 activation, as well as the production of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1b at the level of both mRNA and protein in spleen. Consequently, serum concentrations of these cytokines decreased. Conversely, preemptive injection of a-bungarotoxin, a selective a7nAChR antagonist, reversed these effects of Dex. Our findings indicated that spleen played a critical role in the protective effects of Dex against sepsis and provided further insight into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Dex. 1455073856\n",

This study is based on a cross-sectional survey undertaken in Akershus County in Norway. A total of 19,985 adolescents were included in the study, covering lower secondary and upper secondary students, aged 13-19 years. Chronic headache was measured with a single item question based on headache frequency. Mental health was assessed by using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Internal and external coping strategies were assessed through seven options for answering the question: What do you do/what happens when you are burdened by painful thoughts and feelings? Adolescents with chronic headaches showed more frequent mental health problems overall (23 %) compared to those without chronic headache (6 %). Logistic regression analyses showed that those adolescents having both chronic headaches and comorbid mental health problems more frequently used internal coping strategies, such as keeping feelings inside (OR 2.05), using abusive substances (OR 1.79) and talking oneself out of problems (OR 1.55), compared to those without mental health problems. Groups with mental health problems, especially with chronic headache, less frequently used the external strategy of talking to others about their problem than controls (OR 0.7-0.8). Factor analyses revealed significant differences in profiles of coping strategies between groups. We suggest that attention should be paid towards the high risk group that has both chronic headaches and mental health problems and their tendency to use destructive internal coping strategies. 19868953154\n",

Consequently, DILI is becoming an increasingly serious health problem. However, there is not enough relevant epidemiological data, and the clinical features of these patients are not clear. We conducted this study to report the causes and clinical features of DILI in hospitalized patients, and identify the mortality and predictive factors. We retrospectively collected and analyzed the data of all hospitalized patients whose discharge diagnosis was DILI at the Second Xiangya Hospital between January 2011 and December 2014. The data analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2. Among the 469 patients who were diagnosed with DILI at discharge, 361 met the criteria for DILI on re-evaluation. The crude annual incidence rate of DILI was 92.95 cases per 100,000 patients. Chinese herbal medicine was identified as the primary cause of DILI in 36.01 % of the patients. The overall mortality was 8.59 %. Alcohol consumption, use of antituberculosis drugs, serum total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, thrombinogen time, international normalized ratio, and the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score were significantly correlated with DILI-associated mortality. Among them, the MELD score and albumin were found to be independent predictors of outcome in patients with DILI. Chinese herbal medicine was the primary cause of DILI in the identified patients.

Challenging a widely held view that membrane deformation is a fundamental property of F-BARs, we report that the Cdc15 F-BAR binds, but does not deform, membranes in vivo or in vitro, and six human F-BAR domains-including those from Fer and RhoGAP4-share this property. Nevertheless, tip-to-tip interactions between F-BAR dimers are critical for Cdc15 oligomerization and high-avidity membrane binding, stabilization of contractile ring components at the medial cortex, and the fidelity of cytokinesis. F-BAR oligomerization is also critical for Fer and RhoGAP4 physiological function, demonstrating its broad importance to F-BAR proteins that function without membrane bending.

      "Paternal diet can impact metabolic phenotypes in offspring, but mechanisms underlying such intergenerational information transfer remain obscure. Here, we interrogate cytosine methylation patterns in sperm obtained from mice consuming one of three diets, generating whole genome methylation maps for four pools of sperm samples and for 12 individual sperm samples, as well as 61 genome-scale methylation maps. We find that \"\"epivariation,\"\" either stochastic or due to unknown demographic or environmental factors, was a far stronger contributor to the sperm methylome than was the diet consumed. Variation in cytosine methylation was particularly dramatic over tandem repeat families, including ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats, but rDNA methylation was strongly correlated with genetic variation in rDNA copy number and was not influenced by paternal diet. These results identify loci of genetic and epigenetic lability in the mammalian genome but argue against a direct role for sperm cytosine methylation in dietary reprogramming of offspring metabolism.

      "After neural tube closure, amniotic fluid (AF) captured inside the neural tube forms the nascent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Neuroepithelial stem cells contact CSF-filled ventricles, proliferate, and differentiate to form the mammalian brain, while neurogenic placodes, which generate cranial sensory neurons, remain in contact with the AF. Using in vivo ultrasound imaging, we quantified the expansion of the embryonic ventricular-CSF space from its inception. We developed tools to obtain pure AF and nascent CSF, before and after neural tube closure, and to define how the AF and CSF proteomes diverge during mouse development. Using embryonic neural explants, we demonstrate that age-matched fluids promote Sox2-positive neurogenic identity in developing forebrain and olfactory epithelia. Nascent CSF also stimulates SOX2-positive self-renewal of forebrain progenitor cells, some of which is attributable to LIFR signaling. Our Resource should facilitate the investigation of fluid-tissue interactions during this highly vulnerable stage of early brain development. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

      "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the world, with a substantial health and economic burden confronted by low- and middle-income countries. In low-income countries such as Kenya, there exists a double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and the CVD profile includes many nonatherosclerotic entities. Socio-politico-economic realities present challenges to CVD prevention in Kenya, including poverty, low national spending on health, significant out-of-pocket health expenditures, and limited outpatient health insurance. In addition, the health infrastructure is characterized by insufficient human resources for health, medication stock-outs, and lack of facilities and equipment. Within this socio-politico-economic reality, contextually appropriate programs for CVD prevention need to be developed. We describe our experience from western Kenya, where we have engaged the entire care cascade across all levels of the health system, in order to improve access to high-quality, comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable care for CVD and CVD risk factors. We report on several initiatives: 1) population-wide screening for hypertension and diabetes; 2) engagement of community resources and governance structures; 3) geographic decentralization of care services; 4) task redistribution to more efficiently use of available human resources for health; 5) ensuring a consistent supply of essential medicines; 6) improving physical infrastructure of rural health facilities; 7) developing an integrated health record; and 8) mobile health (mHealth) initiatives to provide clinical decision support and record-keeping functions. Although several challenges remain, there currently exists a critical window of opportunity to establish systems of care and prevention that can alter the trajectory of CVD in low-resource settings.

      "To explore whether patient's personal beliefs about inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and integrative medicine (IM) are discussed at routine primary care visits for asthma. Negative medication beliefs and preferences for IM can be salient barriers to effective asthma self-management. A qualitative analysis of transcripts from 33 audio-recorded primary care visits using conventional content analysis techniques. Four themes emerged when providers had knowledge of patient's beliefs: negative ICS beliefs, IM use for asthma, decision-making and healthy lifestyles. Two themes were identified when providers did not have this knowledge: asthma self-management and healthy lifestyles. When providers had knowledge of their patient's IM endorsement or negative ICS beliefs, they initiated conversations about these modifiable beliefs. Without training in IM and in effective communication techniques, it is unlikely that providers will be able to effectively engage in shared decision-making aimed at improving asthma self-management.

      "Increased neuroplasticity and neural development during puberty provide a context for which stress and trauma can have dramatic and long-lasting effects on psychological systems; therefore, this study was designed to determine whether exposure to potentially traumatic events during puberty uniquely predicts adolescent girls' psychopathology. Because neural substrates associated with different forms of psychopathology seemingly develop at different rates, the possibility that the developmental timing of trauma relative to puberty predicts the nature of psychopathology (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depressive, and anxiety disorders) was examined. A subset of 2,899 adolescent girls from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication-Adolescent Supplement who completed the study 2+ years postmenarche was selected. Past-year psychiatric disorders and reports of age of trauma exposure were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Developmental stages were defined as the 2 years after the year of menarche (\"\"postpuberty\"\"), 3 years before and year of menarche (\"\"puberty\"\"), 2 to 6 years before the puberty period (\"\"grade school\"\"), and 4 to 5 years after birth (\"\"infancy-preschool\"\"). Compared to other developmental periods, trauma during puberty conferred significantly more risk (50.47% of model R(2)) for girls' past-year anxiety disorder diagnoses (primarily social phobia), whereas trauma during the grade school period conferred significantly more risk (47.24% of model R(2)) for past-year depressive disorder diagnoses. Recency of trauma best predicted past-year PTSD diagnoses. Supporting rodent models, puberty may be a sensitive period for the impact of trauma on girls' development of an anxiety disorder. Trauma prepuberty or postpuberty distinctly predicts depression or PTSD, suggesting differential etiological processes. Copyright (c) 2016 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

      "High achievement in school has been associated with increased risk of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), but causality of these relationships is unclear. We sought to examine the association between school achievement and AN or BN in a national cohort and to determine the possible contribution of familial confounding using a co-relative design. This national cohort study involved 1,800,643 persons born in Sweden during 1972 to 1990 who were still living in Sweden at age 16 years and were followed up for AN and BN identified from inpatient and outpatient diagnoses through 2012. We used Cox regression to examine the association between school achievement and subsequent risk of AN or BN, and stratified Cox models to examine the gradient in this association across different strata of co-relative pairs (first cousins, half siblings, full siblings). School achievement was positively associated with risk of AN among females and males (hazard ratio [HR] per additional 1 standard deviation, females: HR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.25-1.33; males: HR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.10-1.52), and risk of BN among females but not males (females: HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.11-1.20; males: HR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.84-1.31). In co-relative analyses, as the degree of shared genetic and environmental factors increased (e.g., from first-cousin to full-sibling pairs), the association between school achievement and AN or BN substantially decreased. In this large national cohort study, high achievement in school was associated with increased risk of AN and BN, but this appeared to be explained by unmeasured familial (genetic and environmental) factors.

      "We examined the association between anticholinergic medication exposure and subsequent cognitive and physical function in patients with delirium superimposed on dementia during rehabilitation. We also examined length of stay and discharge disposition by anticholinergic medication exposure. In this secondary analysis we used control group data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial. Participants with delirium and dementia were enrolled at admission to post-acute care. These 99 participants had a mean age of 86.11 (+-6.83) years; 67.6% were women; 98% were Caucasian; and 33% were positive for at least one APOE e4 allele. We obtained daily measures of cognitive and physical function using: Digit Span; memory, orientation and attention items from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment; CLOX; the Confusion Assessment Method; and the Barthel Index. Anticholinergic medication exposure was measured weekly using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale. Using multilevel models for time we found that greater use of clinically relevant anticholinergic medications in the previous week reduced cognitive and physical function, as measured by Digit Span Backwards and the Barthel index, in the current week. There was no effect of anticholinergic medication use on delirium severity, and APOE status did not moderate any outcomes. Greater use of clinically relevant anticholinergic medications was related to longer length of stay but not discharge disposition. For vulnerable older adults, anticholinergic exposure represents a potentially modifiable risk factor for poor attention, working memory, physical function, and greater length of stay during rehabilitation.

      "Physical and cognitive activities are associated with slower cognitive decline. Few studies have examined racial differences in these associations, however. The aim of this study was to examine the association of physical and cognitive activities with level and change in cognitive function among black and white participants. A secondary aim was to explore observed differences between black and white participants using post hoc analyses based on education and cognitive function levels. Data came from a longitudinal study of 7,742 (63% black and 61% female) participants assessed three times over an average of 9.5 years. At baseline, each participant reported number of hours of leisure time physical activity (categorized using quartiles) and rated frequency of participation in cognitively stimulating activities (range: 0-4). A standardized measure of cognition was derived from tests of memory, perceptual speed, and orientation. Of the 7,742 participants, 2,322 (30%) reported no physical activity. Cognitive decline was slower by about 20% (95% CI: 13%-27%) among whites with physical activity above 1.25 hours compared with those with no physical activity, but showed no significant decrease in cognitive decline relative to those with no physical activity among blacks. Further post hoc analysis revealed cognitive decline to be slower by about 29% (95% CI: 20%-38%) among blacks and whites with higher education and above average baseline cognition. A 1-point increase in cognitive activity frequency decreased cognitive decline by 8% (95% CI: 3%-14%) among blacks and by 14% (95% CI: 7%-20%) among whites. The benefits of higher physical activity on cognitive decline was observed among whites, and among blacks with higher education and above average baseline cognitive function. Nevertheless, the protective effect of cognitive activity seems to be independent of education and baseline cognitive function among both blacks and whites.

Participants also received the Semantic Interference Test (SIT) and AV-45 amyloid PET imaging. High levels of association were present between total amyloid load, regional amyloid levels, and the PSI measure (in the entire sample and a subsample excluding MCI subjects). RSI and other memory measures showed much weaker associations or no associations with total and regional amyloid load. No associations between amyloid levels and non-memory performance were observed. In non-demented individuals, vulnerability to PSI was highly associated with total and regional beta-amyloid load and may be an early cognitive marker of brain pathology.

      "To investigate the relationship between awareness of memory loss and psychological well-being in a nonclinically depressed sample of participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). Study participants (N = 104) enrolled through Columbia University Medical Center and the University of Pennsylvania completed clinical and cognitive assessments. Participants were rated with regard to their degree of awareness of memory deficits and completed questionnaires relating to their psychological well-being, including mood and quality of life (QOL). Mediating models were used to establish the relationship between awareness, depression, and QOL and to examine potential mediators of awareness and depression, including psychological distress, objective memory deficits, and negative self-ratings. There was a direct association between awareness of memory deficits and depressed mood but not awareness and QOL. However, there was an indirect association between awareness and QOL through depression. Neither psychological distress, memory deficits, nor negative self-ratings mediated the relationship between awareness and depression. Awareness is associated with depressed mood in nonclinically depressed participants with mild to moderate AD. However, depressed mood does not appear to reflect the direct psychological reaction to awareness of memory loss. Moreover, awareness has only an indirect association with QOL via depressed mood. These results suggest that preserved awareness does not have a direct negative impact on overall psychological well-being in AD. Copyright (c) 2015 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

The authors analyzed data from 142 persons aged 60 years or older with major depression with psychotic features who participated in a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing olanzapine plus sertraline with olanzapine plus placebo. The independent variables were baseline cerebrovascular risk (Framingham Stroke Risk Score), baseline executive function (Stroop interference score and the initiation/perseveration subscale of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale), and baseline processing speed (color and word reading components of the Stroop). The outcome variable was change in severity of depression, measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score, during the course of the RCT. Greater baseline cerebrovascular risk was significantly associated with less improvement in depression severity over time, after controlling for pertinent covariates. Neither executive function nor processing speed predicted outcome. This study suggests an association of cerebrovascular risk, but not executive function or processing speed, with treatment outcome of major depression with psychotic features in older adults.

      "Large chain restaurants reduced the number of calories in newly introduced menu items in 2013 by about 60 calories (or 12%) relative to 2012. This paper describes trends in calories available in large U.S. chain restaurants to understand whether previously documented patterns persist. Data (a census of items for included restaurants) were obtained from the MenuStat project. This analysis included 66 of the 100 largest U.S. restaurants that are available in all three of the data years (2012-2014; N=23,066 items). Generalized linear models were used to examine: (1) per-item calorie changes from 2012 to 2014 among items on the menu in all years; and (2) mean calories in new items in 2013 and 2014 compared with items on the menu in 2012 only. Data were analyzed in 2014. Overall, calories in newly introduced menu items declined by 71 (or 15%) from 2012 to 2013 (p=0.001) and by 69 (or 14%) from 2012 to 2014 (p=0.03). These declines were concentrated mainly in new main course items (85 fewer calories in 2013 and 55 fewer calories in 2014; p=0.01). Although average calories in newly introduced menu items are declining, they are higher than items common to the menu in all 3 years. No differences in mean calories among items on menus in 2012, 2013, or 2014 were found. The previously observed declines in newly introduced menu items among large restaurant chains have been maintained, which suggests the beginning of a trend toward reducing calories.

We tested the effectiveness of providing weekly dietary advice, assistance with selection of higher potassium grocery items, and a $30 per week food allowance on blood pressure and other outcomes in African American adults with hypertension. We conducted an 8-week RCT with two parallel arms between May 2012 and November 2013. We randomized 123 African Americans with controlled hypertension from an urban primary care clinic in Baltimore, Maryland, and implemented the trial in partnership with a community supermarket and the Baltimore City Health Department. Mean (SD) age was 58.6 (9.5) years; 71% were female; blood pressure was 131.3 (14.7)/77.2 (10.5) mmHg; BMI was 34.5 (8.2); and 28% had diabetes. Participants randomized to the active intervention group (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH]-Plus) received coach-directed dietary advice and assistance with weekly online ordering and purchasing of high-potassium foods ($30/week) delivered by a community supermarket to a neighborhood library. Participants in the control group received a printed DASH diet brochure along with a debit account of equivalent value to that of the DASH-Plus group. The primary outcome was blood pressure change. Analyses were conducted in January to October 2014. Compared with the control group, the DASH-Plus group increased self-reported consumption of fruits and vegetables (mean=1.4, 95% CI=0.7, 2.1 servings/day); estimated intake of potassium (mean=0.4, 95% CI=0.1, 0.7 grams/day); and urine potassium excretion (mean=19%, 95% CI=1%, 38%). There was no significant effect on blood pressure. A program providing dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering, and $30/week of high-potassium foods in African American patients with controlled hypertension in a community-based clinic did not reduce BP.

Novel lifestyle activity interventions that can effectively increase physical activity may address disparities in health in these populations. This study evaluates the effects of the Baltimore Experience Corps program, a community-based volunteer program, on walking activity in older adults. The Baltimore Experience Corps Trial is a sex-stratified RCT that recruited participants from 2006 to 2009. Older adult participants aged >=60 years (n=123) were from a nested objective physical activity trial within the larger Baltimore Experience Corps Trial. Participants randomized to the intervention group were placed as volunteers within the Baltimore public school system for 2 years. The primary study outcome was objectively measured total amount of walking activity measured in steps/day. Differences between intervention and control groups were measured at 12 and 24 months using linear mixed effects models. Data were analyzed in 2014. At 24 months, women, but not men, in the intervention group showed an increased amount of walking activity, averaging 1,500.3 (95% CI=77.6, 2,922.9) greater steps/day compared with the control group. Women in the control group showed a decline of 1,191.6 (95% CI=-2243.7, -139.5) steps/day at 24 months compared to baseline.

      "Research suggests that community involvement is integral to solving public health problems, including involvement in clinical trials-a gold standard. Significant racial/ethnic disparities exist in the accrual of participants for clinical trials. Location and cultural aspects of clinical trials influence recruitment and accrual to clinical trials. It is increasingly necessary to be aware of defining characteristics, such as location and culture of the populations from which research participants are enrolled. Little research has examined the effect of location and cultural competency in adapting clinical trial research for minority and underserved communities on accrual for clinical trials. Utilizing embedded community academic sites, the authors applied cultural competency frameworks to adapt clinical trial research in order to increase minority participation in nontherapeutic cancer clinical trials. This strategy resulted in successful accrual of participants to new clinical research trials, specifically targeting participation from minority and underserved communities in metropolitan Washington, DC. From 2012 to 2014, a total of 559 participants enrolled across six nontherapeutic clinical trials, representing a 62% increase in the enrollment of blacks in clinical research. Embedding cancer prevention programs and research in the community was shown to be yet another important strategy in the arsenal of approaches that can potentially enhance clinical research enrollment and capacity. The analyses showed that the capacity to acquire cultural knowledge about patients-their physical locales, cultural values, and environments in which they live-is essential to recruiting culturally and ethnically diverse population samples.

      "Current attempts at understanding the heterogeneity in obsessive-compulsive disorder have relied on quantitative methods. The results of such work point toward a dimensional structure for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Existing qualitative work in obsessive-compulsive disorder has focused on understanding specific aspects of the obsessive-compulsive disorder experience in greater depth. However, qualitative methods are also of potential value in furthering our understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder heterogeneity by allowing for open-ended exploration of the obsessive-compulsive disorder experience and correlating identified subtypes with patient narratives. We explored variations in patients' experience prior to, during and immediately after performing their compulsions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder, followed by inductive thematic analysis. Participant responses were not analyzed within the context of an existing theoretical framework, and themes were labeled descriptively. The previous dichotomy of 'anxiety' vs 'incompleteness' emerged organically during narrative analysis. In addition, we found that some individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder utilized their behaviors as a way to cope with stress and anxiety more generally. Other participants did not share this experience and denied finding any comfort in their obsessive-compulsive behaviors. The consequences of attentional difficulties were highlighted, with some participants describing how difficulty focusing on a task could influence the need for it to be repeated multiple times. The extent to which patients use obsessive-compulsive disorder as a coping mechanism is a relevant distinction with potential implications for treatment engagement. Patients may experience ambivalence about suppressing behaviors that they have come to rely upon for management of stress and anxiety, even if these behaviors represent symptoms of a psychiatric illness.

A systematic search was conducted from 1980 until 2014 to identify studies that used psychometric tools or structured instruments to assess aggression and violence risk. Information from primary studies was extracted, including demographic characteristics of the samples used, study design characteristics, and reliability and validity estimates. A total of 30 primary studies were identified that investigated aggression or violence; 6 reported on tools assessing aggression while an additional 24 studies reported on structured instruments designed to predict violence. Although measures of reliability were typically good, estimates of predictive validity were mostly in the range of poor to moderate, with only 1 study finding good validity. These estimates were typically lower than that found in previous work for Western samples. There is currently little evidence to support the use of current violence risk assessment instruments in psychiatric patients in China. Developing more accurate and scalable approaches are research priorities. (c) The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2015. 19111007643\n",

      "To identify therapeutic targets for glioblastoma (GBM), we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screens in patient-derived GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) and human neural stem/progenitors (NSCs), non-neoplastic stem cell controls, for genes required for their in vitro growth. Surprisingly, the vast majority GSC-lethal hits were found outside of molecular networks commonly altered in GBM and GSCs (e.g., oncogenic drivers). In vitro and in vivo validation of GSC-specific targets revealed several strong hits, including the wee1-like kinase, PKMYT1/Myt1. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that PKMYT1 acts redundantly with WEE1 to inhibit cyclin B-CDK1 activity via CDK1-Y15 phosphorylation and to promote timely completion of mitosis in NSCs. However, in GSCs, this redundancy is lost, most likely as a result of oncogenic signaling, causing GBM-specific lethality. Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate the role of lncRNA ceruloplasmin (NRCP) in cancer metabolism and elucidate functional effects leading to increased tumor progression. NRCP was highly upregulated in ovarian tumors, and knockdown of NRCP resulted in significantly increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased glycolysis compared with control cancer cells. In an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, siNRCP delivered via a liposomal carrier significantly reduced tumor growth compared with control treatment. We identified NRCP as an intermediate binding partner between STAT1 and RNA polymerase II, leading to increased expression of downstream target genes such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Collectively, we report a previously unrecognized role of the lncRNA NRCP in modulating cancer metabolism. As demonstrated, DOPC nanoparticle-incorporated siRNA-mediated silencing of this lncRNA in vivo provides therapeutic avenue toward modulating lncRNAs in cancer. Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

      "Floating dosage forms are an important formulation strategy for drugs with a narrow absorption window and low intestinal solubility, and for localized gastric treatment. Novel floating pellets were prepared using the hot-melt extrusion (HME) technology. Uniformly foamed strands were created by liquid injection pumping and screw configuration modification. The ammonio methacrylate copolymer (Eudragit(r) RSPO) foaming structure was formed by a liquid-vapor phase transition inside the strand upon die exiting resulting from the sudden decrease in external pressure, vaporizing the liquid ethanol and vacating the extruded material. This generated uniform vacuous regions in the extrudate. The pellets' internal structure was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The formulation constituents' and processing parameters' effects on the drug release profiles, floating force, and the pellets' micromeritic properties were evaluated by design of experiments: all formulations showed zero lag time and excellent floating strength, indicating immediate-floating pellet formation. The pellets' drug release profiles were controlled by multiple independent variables at different time points (24h). Drug loading significantly affected drug release within the first hour, the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) content thereafter. Understanding the variables' effects on the formulations allows for the tailoring of this delivery system to obtain various drug release profiles. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Up to 30% of patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) are found to have features of aggressive disease at radical prostatectomy (RP). Several predictive nomograms and novel genomic markers have been developed to estimate the risk of adverse pathology in men eligible for active surveillance (AS). However, oncologic risk associated with these findings remains unknown. To determine if the presence of adverse pathologic features at RP in patients eligible for AS is prognostic of poor oncologic outcome independent of pretreatment risk status. A total of 2660 patients underwent immediate RP at our institution between 1998 and 2008. Patients were stratified as low, intermediate, or high risk according to the D'Amico clinical risk criteria. The rates of adverse pathology were reported, and the 5-yr risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) was calculated in the presence of aggressive disease. The 5-yr risk of BCR in patients with extracapsular extension (n=937) was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40-46) overall but only 15% (95% CI, 11-22) for those who met the criteria for low risk (n=181). For the 473 patients with pathologic Gleason score 4+3, the risk of recurrence at 5 yr was 41% (95% CI, 37-46) overall, 13% (95% CI, 5-27) for low-risk men (n=41), 41% (95% CI, 35-47) for intermediate-risk men (n=287), and 51% (95% CI, 43-60) for high-risk men (n=145). Limitations include use of BCR as the study end point and surrogate for oncologic outcome in men who received curative treatment. The presence of pathologically unfavorable disease in patients eligible for AS is not informative as to the safety of this treatment modality. We question the relevance of adverse pathology as the end point for predictive tools designed to guide treatment decisions in low-risk PCa. The risk of biochemical recurrence associated with adverse pathologic findings at prostatectomy is reduced by approximately 50% in men with clinically low-risk prostate cancer.

      "Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes two types of external genital lesions (EGLs) in men: genital warts (condyloma) and penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN). The purpose of this study was to describe genital HPV progression to a histopathologically confirmed HPV-related EGL. A prospective analysis nested within the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) study was conducted among 3033 men. At each visit, visually distinct EGLs were biopsied; the biopsy specimens were subjected to pathologic evaluation and categorized by pathologic diagnoses. Genital swabs and biopsies were used to identify HPV types using the Linear Array genotyping method for swabs and INNO-LiPA for biopsy specimens. EGL incidence was determined among 1788 HPV-positive men, and cumulative incidence rates at 6, 12, and 24 mo were estimated. The proportion of HPV infections that progressed to EGL was also calculated, along with median time to EGL development. Among 1788 HPV-positive men, 92 developed an incident EGL during follow-up (9 PeIN and 86 condyloma). During the first 12 mo of follow-up, 16% of men with a genital HPV 6 infection developed an HPV 6-positive condyloma, and 22% of genital HPV 11 infections progressed to an HPV 11-positive condyloma. During the first 12 mo of follow-up, 0.5% of men with a genital HPV 16 infection developed an HPV 16-positive PeIN. Although we expected PeIN to be a rare event, the sample size for PeIN (n=10) limited the types of analyses that could be performed. Most EGLs develop following infection with HPV 6, 11, or 16, all of which could be prevented with the 4-valent HPV vaccine. In this study, we looked at genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections that can cause lesions in men. The HPV that we detected within the lesions could be prevented by a vaccine.

      "Weight gain is associated with an increase in intrahepatic triglycerides (IHTGs), and is the primary cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obese individuals. We combined imaging and stable isotope tracer techniques to evaluate the physiologic mechanisms of weight gain-induced steatosis in 27 obese people. Weight gain appeared to increase IHTG content by generating an imbalance between hepatic fatty acid availability and disposal, and resulted in increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, decreased intrahepatic fatty acid oxidation, and inadequate increases in IHTG export via very low-density lipoprotein secretion.

      "Colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori and its role in causing gastric cancer is one of the richest examples of a complex relationship among human cells, microbes, and their environment. It is also a puzzle of enormous medical importance given the incidence and lethality of gastric cancer worldwide. We review recent findings that have changed how we view these relationships and affected the direction of gastric cancer research. For example, recent data have indicated that subtle mismatches between host and microbe genetic traits greatly affect the risk of gastric cancer. The ability of H pylori and its oncoprotein CagA to reprogram epithelial cells and activate properties of stemness show the sophisticated relationship between H pylori and progenitor cells in the gastric mucosa. The observation that cell-associated H pylori can colonize the gastric glands and directly affect precursor and stem cells supports these observations. The ability to mimic these interactions in human gastric organoid cultures as well as animal models will allow investigators to more fully unravel the extent of H pylori control on the renewing gastric epithelium. Finally, our realization that external environmental factors, such as dietary components and essential micronutrients, as well as the gastrointestinal microbiota, can change the balance between H pylori's activity as a commensal or a pathogen has provided direction to studies aimed at defining the full carcinogenic potential of this organism.

      "Esophageal biopsy specimens from patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) can feel firm, with resistance felt when pulling the forceps to obtain the tissue sample. We aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of the esophageal biopsy \"\"pull\"\" sign and determine its histologic associations and response to treatment. This was a prospective cohort study of adults undergoing outpatient upper endoscopy. Cases of EoE were diagnosed per consensus guidelines, and patients were subsequently treated with either topical steroids or dietary elimination. Control subjects were individuals who did not have EoE. The frequency of the esophageal biopsy \"\"pull\"\" sign was assessed in EoE patients and controls, and diagnostic metrics were calculated. The \"\"pull\"\" sign was also reassessed in patients after therapy. A total of 83 EoE patients and 121 control subjects were included. Sixty-three EoE patients (76%) were \"\"pull\"\" sign positive compared with just 2 control subjects (2%; P < .001), corresponding to a sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 98%, positive and negative predictive values of 97% and 86%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 45.9 and 0.245, respectively. The \"\"pull\"\" sign was the strongest endoscopic predictor of EoE case status at baseline and was less frequent after successful treatment (20% vs 79%; P < .001). The \"\"pull\"\" sign is highly specific for EoE and is rarely seen in non-EoE control subjects. In patients with EoE who respond to treatment, the \"\"pull\"\" sign often resolves. The \"\"pull\"\" sign may be a simple and easily obtained measure of esophageal remodeling. Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

      "Previous studies show that microendoscopic images can be interpreted visually to identify the presence of neoplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), but this approach is subjective and requires clinical expertise. This study describes an approach for quantitative image analysis of microendoscopic images to identify neoplastic lesions in patients with BE. Images were acquired from 230 sites from 58 patients by using a fiberoptic high-resolution microendoscope during standard endoscopic procedures. Images were analyzed by a fully automated image processing algorithm, which automatically selected a region of interest and calculated quantitative image features. Image features were used to develop an algorithm to identify the presence of neoplasia; results were compared with a histopathology diagnosis. A sequential classification algorithm that used image features related to glandular and cellular morphology resulted in a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 85%. Applying the algorithm to an independent validation set resulted in a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 85%. This pilot study demonstrates that automated analysis of microendoscopic images can provide an objective, quantitative framework to assist clinicians in evaluating esophageal lesions from patients with BE.

      "The aims of this article were to review the discrepancy between numbers of people requiring weight loss treatment and results and to assess the potential effects of pharmacologic treatments (recently approved for obesity) and endoscopically deployed devices on quantitative GI traits in development for obesity treatment. We conducted a review of relevant literature to achieve our objectives. The 2013 guidelines increased the number of adults recommended for weight loss treatment by 20.9% (116.0 million to 140.2 million). There is an imbalance between efficacy and costs of commercial weight loss programs and drug therapy (average weight loss about 5 kg). The number of bariatric procedures performed in the United States has doubled in the past decade. The efficacy of bariatric surgery is attributed to reduction in the volume of the stomach, nutrient malabsorption with some types of surgery, increased postprandial incretin responses, and activation of farnesoid X receptor mechanisms. These GI and behavioral traits identify sub-phenotypes of obesity, based on recent research. The mechanisms or traits targeted by drug and device treatments include centrally mediated alterations of appetite or satiation, diversion of nutrients, and alteration of stomach capacity, gastric emptying, or incretin hormones. Future treatment may be individualized based on quantitative GI and behavioral traits measured in obese patients. Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

      "For more than 4 decades endoscopists have relied on ulcer stigmata for risk stratification and as a guide to hemostasis. None used arterial blood flow underneath stigmata to predict outcomes. For patients with severe peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB), we used a Doppler endoscopic probe (DEP) for (1) detection of blood flow underlying stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH), (2) quantitating rates of residual arterial blood flow under SRH after visually directed standard endoscopic treatment, and (3) comparing risks of rebleeding and actual 30-day rebleed rates for spurting arterial bleeding (Forrest [F] IA) and oozing bleeding (F IB). Prospective cohort study of 163 consecutive patients with severe PUB and different SRH. All blood flow detected by the DEP was arterial. Detection rates were 87.4% in major SRH-spurting arterial bleeding (F IA), non-bleeding visible vessel (F IIA), clot (F IIB)-and were significantly lower at 42.3% (P < .0001) for an intermediate group of oozing bleeding (F IB) or flat spot (F IIC). For spurting bleeding (F IA) versus oozing (F IB), baseline DEP arterial flow was 100% versus 46.7%, residual blood flow detected after endoscopic hemostasis was 35.7% versus 0%, and 30-day rebleed rates were 28.6% versus 0% (all P < .05). (1) For major SRH versus oozing or spot, the arterial blood flow detection rate by the DEP was significantly higher, indicating a higher rebleed risk. (2) Before and after endoscopic treatment, spurting (F IA) PUB had significantly higher rates of blood flow detection than oozing (F IB) PUB and a significantly higher 30-day rebleed rate. (3) The DEP is recommended as a new endoscopic guide with SRH to improve risk stratification and potentially definitive hemostasis for PUB. Published by Elsevier Inc. 10160887666\n",

      "NGLY1/Ngly1 is a cytosolic peptide:N-glycanase, i.e. de-N-glycosylating enzyme acting on N-glycoproteins in mammals, generating free, unconjugated N-glycans and deglycosylated peptides in which the N-glycosylated asparagine residues are converted to aspartates. This enzyme is known to be involved in the quality control system for the newly synthesized glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this system, misfolded (glyco)proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosol, where the 26S proteasomes play a central role in degrading the proteins: a process referred to as ER-associated degradation or ERAD in short. PNGase-mediated deglycosylation is believed to facilitate the efficient degradation of some misfolded glycoproteins. Human patients harboring mutations of NGLY1 gene (NGLY1-deficiency) have recently been discovered, clearly indicating the functional importance of this enzyme. This review summarizes the current state of our knowledge on NGLY1 and its gene product in mammalian cells. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. +86-75375954704\n",

Time trends in annual prevalences of cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes among a non-vaccinated, HIV-infected female cohort in urban Brazil were assessed for the period 2006-2012. Cervical specimens were collected for HPV genotyping yearly between January 2006 and December 2012 in a cross-sectional analysis of participants aged >=18 years enrolled in the Women's HIV Cohort at Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Age-adjusted generalized estimating equation models with an exchangeable matrix were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for annual HPV positivity (reference year: 2006). Among the 590 participants, the median age across all study years ranged from 35.5 to 40.0 years. The prevalence of any HR-HPV was >=53% every year; prevalences of HR-HPV 16, 58, 59, and 68 were >=24% in at least 1 year. The odds of HPV 16 and 68 decreased in 2012. HPV 58 prevalence followed a U-shape, beginning and ending at >20%. HPV 59 prevalence followed a linear trend, with increased odds in 2012 (OR 16.0, 95% CI 3.8-67.3; Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <0.01). The prevalences of HR-HPV 58, 59, and 68 were high in this cohort. Given current HR-HPV vaccine coverage and availability, further investigations are needed to optimize vaccine recommendations for this population. Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

      "The aim of this study was to identify the genetic relatedness of multiple drug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates recovered from a hospital in Los Angeles. Twenty-one MDR A. baumannii isolates were collected and their antibiotic susceptibilities determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Genes coding for antibiotic resistance were identified by PCR, and their identities were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Clonal relationships were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). MDR consistently correlated with the presence of oxacillinases, mostly in the form of the plasmid-mediated OXA-23 enzyme, which was detected in 12 (57.1%) isolates. GES-type carbapenemases were found in 20 (95.2%) strains, AAC in all 21 (100%) strains, and PER in seven (33.3%) strains, and ISAba1 was detected in 16 (76.2%) isolates. The association between ISAba1 and resistance genes confirms insertion elements as a source of b-lactamase production. Of the 21 clinical isolates, five were found to be related to sequence type 1 (ST1) and 16 to ST2, as analyzed by MLST. PFGE demonstrated that the majority of clinical isolates were highly related (>85%). This study supports a more complete understanding of genotyping of antibiotic resistance for better assessment of MDR strain transmission. Copyright (c) 2015. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

      "The interaction between cytochrome c and the anionic lipid cardiolipin has been proposed as a primary event in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Numerous studies that have examined the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin embedded in a variety of model phospholipid membranes have suggested that partial unfolding of the protein is a precursor to the apoptotic response. However, these studies lacked site resolution and used model systems with negligible or a positive membrane curvature, which is distinct from the large negative curvature of the invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane where cytochrome c resides. We have used reverse micelle encapsulation to mimic the potential effects of confinement on the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin. Encapsulation of oxidized horse cytochrome c in 1-decanoyl-rac-glycerol/lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide/hexanol reverse micelles prepared in pentane yields NMR spectra essentially identical to the protein in free aqueous solution. The structure of encapsulated ferricytochrome c was determined to high precision (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ~ 0.23 A) using NMR-based methods and is closely similar to the cryogenic crystal structure (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ~ 1.2 A). Incorporation of cardiolipin into the reverse micelle surfactant shell causes localized chemical shift perturbations of the encapsulated protein, providing the first view of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction interface at atomic resolution. Three distinct sites of interaction are detected: the so-called A- and L-sites, plus a previously undocumented interaction centered on residues Phe-36, Gly-37, Thr-58, Trp-59, and Lys-60. Importantly, in distinct contrast to earlier studies of this interaction, the protein is not significantly disturbed by the binding of cardiolipin in the context of the reverse micelle.

      "The HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat is implicated in the neuronal damage that contributes to neurocognitive impairment affecting people living with HIV/AIDS. Aberrant splicing of TAU exon 10 results in tauopathies characterized by alterations in the proportion of TAU isoforms containing three (3R) or four (4R) microtubule-binding repeats. The splicing factor SC35/SRSF2 binds to nuclear RNA and facilitates the incorporation of exon 10 in the TAU molecule. Here, we utilized clinical samples, an animal model, and neuronal cell cultures and found that Tat promotes TAU 3R up-regulation through increased levels of phosphorylated SC35, which is retained in nuclear speckles. This mechanism involved Tat-mediated increased expression of DYRK1A and was prevented by DYRK1A silencing. In addition, we found that Tat associates with TAU RNA, further demonstrating that Tat interferes with host RNA metabolism in the absence of viral infection. Altogether, our data unravel a novel mechanism of Tat-mediated neuronal toxicity through dysregulation of the SC35-dependent alternative splicing of TAU exon 10. Furthermore, the increased immunostaining of DYRK1A in HIV+ brains without pathology points at dysregulation of DYRK1A as an early event in the neuronal complications of HIV infection.

      "Lasso peptide isopeptidase is an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the isopeptide bond of lasso peptides, rendering these peptides linear. To carry out a detailed structure-activity analysis of the lasso peptide isopeptidase AtxE2 from Asticcacaulis excentricus, we solved NMR structures of its substrates astexin-2 and astexin-3. Using in vitro enzyme assays, we show that the C-terminal tail portion of these peptides is dispensable with regards to isopeptidase activity. A collection of astexin-2 and astexin-3 variants with alanine substitutions at each position within the ring and the loop was constructed, and we showed that all of these peptides except for one were cleaved by the isopeptidase. Thus, much like the lasso peptide biosynthetic enzymes, lasso peptide isopeptidase has broad substrate specificity. Quantitative analysis of the cleavage reactions indicated that alanine substitutions in loop positions of these peptides led to reduced cleavage, suggesting that the loop is serving as a recognition element for the isopeptidase.

      "The risk for heart failure and death after myocardial infarction is abnormally high in diabetic subjects. We and others have shown previously that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) improves functional recovery of the rodent heart during reperfusion. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of hyperinsulinemia in mice down-regulates myocardial UCP3. Decreased UCP3 expression was linked to the development of selective insulin resistance in the heart, characterized by decreased basal activity of Akt but preserved activity of the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and overactivation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1-mediated lipogenic program. In cultured myocytes, insulin treatment and SREBP-1 overexpression decreased, whereas SREBP-1 interference increased, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-stimulated expression of UCP3. Promoter deletion and site-directed mutagenesis identified three functional sterol regulatory elements in the vicinity of a known complex intronic enhancer. Increased binding of SREBP-1 to this DNA region was confirmed in the heart of hyperinsulinemic mice. In conclusion, we describe a hitherto unknown regulatory mechanism by which insulin inhibits cardiac UCP3 expression through activation of the lipogenic factor SREBP-1. Sustained down-regulation of cardiac UCP3 by hyperinsulinemia may partly explain the poor prognosis of type 2 diabetic patients after myocardial infarction.

We used four-stage approach to develop ROBIS: define the scope, review the evidence base, hold a face-to-face meeting, and refine the tool through piloting. ROBIS is currently aimed at four broad categories of reviews mainly within health care settings: interventions, diagnosis, prognosis, and etiology. The target audience of ROBIS is primarily guideline developers, authors of overviews of systematic reviews (\"\"reviews of reviews\"\"), and review authors who might want to assess or avoid risk of bias in their reviews. The tool is completed in three phases: (1) assess relevance (optional), (2) identify concerns with the review process, and (3) judge risk of bias. Phase 2 covers four domains through which bias may be introduced into a systematic review: study eligibility criteria; identification and selection of studies; data collection and study appraisal; and synthesis and findings. Phase 3 assesses the overall risk of bias in the interpretation of review findings and whether this considered limitations identified in any of the phase 2 domains. Signaling questions are included to help judge concerns with the review process (phase 2) and the overall risk of bias in the review (phase 3); these questions flag aspects of review design related to the potential for bias and aim to help assessors judge risk of bias in the review process, results, and conclusions.

      "Behavioral models relevant to stroke research seek to capture important aspects of motor skills typically impaired in human patients, such as coordination of distal musculature. Such models may focus on mice since many genetic tools are available for use only in that species and since the training and behavioral demands of mice can differ from rats even for superficially similar behavioral readouts. However, current mouse assays are time consuming to train and score, especially in a manner producing continuous quantification. An automated assay of mouse forelimb function may provide advantages for quantification and speed, and may be useful for many applications including stroke research. We present an automated assay of distal forelimb function. In this task, mice reach forward, grip and pull an isometric handle with a prescribed force. The apparatus partially automates the training process so that mice can be trained quickly and simultaneously. Using this apparatus, it is possible to measure long-lasting impairment in success rate, force pulled, latency to pull, and latency to success up to 22 weeks following photothrombotic cortical strokes in mice. This assessment measures forelimb function as do pellet reach tasks, but it utilizes a different motion and provides automatic measures that can ease and augment the research process. This high-throughput behavioral assay can detect long-lasting motor impairments, eliminates the need for subjective scoring, and produces a rich, continuous data set from which many aspects of the reach and grasp motion can be automatically extracted.

While this technique has provided powerful new information, in vivo two-photon chronic imaging around tethered cortical implants, such as microelectrodes or neural probes, present unique challenges. A number of strategies are described to prepare a cranial window to longitudinally observe the impact of neural probes on brain tissue and vasculature for up to 3 months. It was found that silastic sealants limit cell infiltration into the craniotomy, thereby limiting light scattering and preserving window clarity over time. In contrast, low concentration hydrogel sealants failed to prevent cell infiltration and their use at high concentration displaced brain tissue and disrupted probe performance. The use of silastic sealants allows for a suitable imaging window for long term chronic experiments and revealed new insights regarding the dynamic leukocyte response around implants and the nature of chronic BBB leakage in the sub-dural space.

      "Animal models capable of differentiating the neurobiological intricacies between physical and emotional stress are scarce. Current models rely primarily on physical stressors (e.g., chronic unpredictable or mild stress, social defeat, learned helplessness), and neglect the impact of psychological stress alone. This is surprising given extensive evidence that a traumatic event needs not be directly experienced to produce enduring perturbations on an individual's health and psychological well-being. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a highly debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear of trauma-related stimuli, often occurs in individuals that have only witnessed a traumatic event. By modifying the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm to include a witness component (witnessing the social defeat of another mouse), we demonstrate a novel behavioral paradigm capable of inducing a robust behavioral syndrome reminiscent of PTSD in emotionally stressed adult mice. We describe the vicarious social defeat stress (VSDS) model that is capable of inducing a host of behavioral deficits that include social avoidance and other depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes in adult male mice. VSDS exposure induces weight loss and spike in serum corticosterone (CORT) levels. A month after stress, these mice retain the social avoidant phenotype and have an increased CORT response when exposed to subsequent stress. The VSDS is a novel paradigm capable of inducing emotional stress by isolating physical stress/confrontation in mice. The VSDS model can be used to study the short- and long-term neurobiological consequences of exposure to emotional stress in mice. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study the potential role of survival bias in the relationship between HPV tumor status and the timing of recurrence was evaluated, given conflicting evidence in the literature. A secondary analysis was performed on a previously published retrospective two institution study of recurrent OPSCC with known HPV tumor status. Patients were categorized as \"\"early\"\" (surviving <24months) or \"\"late\"\" survivors (24months). Timing of first recurrence and overall survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and cox proportional hazard methods. Two-sided p-values <0.05 were considered significant. In total 101 patients met criteria including 81 late and 20 early survivors. HPV-positive tumor status was associated with longer time to recurrence in late survivors (median 21.8 vs. 13.8months, p=0.028). Late survivors had later recurrences in HPV-positive (p<0.001) and HPV-negative patients (p=0.0096), as well as in both locoregional (p<0.0001) and distant metastatic recurrence (p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, both HPV-positive tumor status (adjusted HR [aHR] 0.48, p=0.006) and survival beyond 24months (aHR 0.21, p<0.001) were associated with later recurrence. When stratified, HPV tumor status was only associated with later recurrence in late survivors (aHR 0.47, p=0.015). Late survivorship was associated with late recurrence for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients. Stratification by survival illustrates how survival bias links late survivorship with late recurrences and contributes to our understanding of the impact of HPV tumor status on the timing of recurrence.

      "We assessed the clinical utility of routine electroencephalography (EEG) in the prediction of epilepsy onset in asymptomatic infants with tuberous sclerosis complex. This multicenter prospective observational study recruited infants younger than 7 months, seizure-free and on no antiepileptic drugs at enrollment, who all underwent serial physical examinations and video EEGs throughout the study. Parental education on seizure recognition was completed at the time of initial enrollment. Once seizure onset occurred, standard of care was applied, and subjects were followed up until 24 months. Forty patients were enrolled, 28 older than 12 months with completed EEG evaluation at the time of this interim analysis. Of those, 19 (67.8%) developed seizures. Epileptic spasms occurred in 10 (52.6%), focal seizures in five (26.3%), generalized tonic-clonic seizure in one (5.3%), and a combination of epileptic spasms and focal seizures in three (15.7%). Fourteen infants (73.6%) had the first emergence of epileptiform abnormalities on EEG at an average age 4.2 months, preceding seizure onset by a median of 1.9 months. Hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia was not found in any infant before onset of epileptic spasms. All children with epileptiform discharges subsequently developed epilepsy (100% positive predictive value), and the negative predictive value for not developing epilepsy after a normal EEG was 64%. Serial routine EEGs in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex is a feasible strategy to identify individuals at high risk for epilepsy.

      "Prenatal nicotinic exposure (PNE) prolongs bronchopulmonary C-fiber (PCF)-mediated apneic response to intra-atrial bolus injection of capsaicin in rat pups. The relevant mechanisms remain unclear. Pulmonary substance P and adenosine and their receptors (neurokinin-A receptor, NK1R and ADA1 receptor, ADA1R) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) expressed on PCFs are critical for PCF sensitization and/or activation. Here, we compared substance P and adenosine in BALF and NK1R, ADA1R, and TRPV1 expression in the nodose/jugular (N/J) ganglia (vagal pulmonary C-neurons retrogradely labeled) between Ctrl and PNE pups. We found that PNE failed to change BALF substance P and adenosine content, but significantly upregulated both mRNA and protein TRPV1 and NK1R in the N/J ganglia and only NK1R mRNA in pulmonary C-neurons. To define the role of NK1R in the PNE-induced PCF sensitization, the apneic response to capsaicin (i.v.) without or with pretreatment of SR140333 (a peripheral and selective NK1R antagonist) was compared and the prolonged apnea by PNE significantly shortened by SR140333. To clarify if the PNE-evoked responses depended on action of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly a7nAChR, mecamylamine or methyllycaconitine (a general nAChR or a selective a7nAChR antagonist) was administrated via another mini-pump over the PNE period. Mecamylamine or methyllycaconitine eliminated the PNE-evoked mRNA and protein responses. Our data suggest that PNE is able to elevate PCF NK1R expression via activation of nAChRs, especially a7nAChR, which likely contributes to sensitize PCFs and prolong the PCF-mediated apneic response to capsaicin.

      "Acute liver failure can be the consequence of various etiologies, with most cases arising from drug-induced hepatotoxicity in Western countries. Despite advances in this field, the management of acute liver failure continues to be one of the most challenging problems in clinical medicine. The availability of adequate experimental models is of crucial importance to provide a better understanding of this condition and to allow identification of novel drug targets, testing the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions and acting as models for assessing mechanisms of toxicity. Experimental models of hepatotoxicity related to acute liver failure rely on surgical procedures, chemical exposure or viral infection. Each of these models has a number of strengths and weaknesses. This paper specifically reviews commonly used chemical in vivo and in vitro models of hepatotoxicity associated with acute liver failure. Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

      "Ophthalmic gene therapy is an intellectual and intentional manipulation of desired gene expression into the specific cells of an eye for the treatment of ophthalmic (ocular) genetic dystrophies and pathological conditions. Exogenous nucleic acids such as DNA, small interfering RNA, micro RNA, and so on, are used for the purpose of managing expression of the desired therapeutic proteins in ocular tissues. The delivery of unprotected nucleic acids into the cells is limited because of exogenous and endogenous degradation modalities. Nanotechnology, a promising and sophisticated cutting edge tool, works as a protective shelter for these therapeutic nucleic acids. They can be safely delivered to the required cells in order to modulate anticipated protein expression. To this end, nanotechnology is seen as a potential and promising strategy in the field of ocular gene delivery. This review focused on current nanotechnology modalities and other promising nonviral strategies being used to deliver therapeutic genes in order to treat various devastating ocular diseases.
